<h2 class="nobreak" id="FOREWORD">FOREWORD</h2>
</div>

<p>The term “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i>”&mdash;a word of vague origin,
once applied with contempt to the American
in Mexico&mdash;is now used throughout Latin
America, without its former opprobrium, to describe
any foreigner.</p>

<p>The Spanish “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mañana</i>”&mdash;literally “to-morrow”&mdash;is
extremely popular south of the Rio Grande,
where, in phrases suggesting postponement, it enables
the inhabitant to solve many of life’s most perplexing
problems.</p>

<p>This book covers various random wanderings in
Mexico, Guatemala, Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua,
and Costa Rica. It deals with a romance or two, a
revolution or so, and a hodge-podge of personal experience.
The incidents of the earlier chapters precede,
while those of the later ones follow, the
author’s vagabond journeys recorded in “The Adventures
of a Tropical Tramp,” and “A Beachcomber
in the Orient.”</p>

<p>The chapter on the Yaqui Indians is published
with the permission of the editor of “The Open
Road.” The photographs of the Guatemalan revolution
were taken by Roy Neil Bunstine, of Guatemala
City.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br /><small>ON THE BORDER</small></h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>It was my original plan to ride from Arizona to
Panama by automobile.</p>

<p>In fact, I even went so far as to purchase
the automobile. It had been newly painted, and the
second-hand dealer assured me that no car in all
the border country had a greater reputation.</p>

<p>This proved to be the truth. The first stranger I
met grinned at my new prize with an air of pleased
recognition.</p>

<p>“Well! Well!” he exclaimed. “Do <em>you</em> own it
now?”</p>

<p>So did the second stranger, and the third. I had
acquired not only an automobile, but a definite standing
in the community. People who had hitherto
passed me without a glance now smiled at me.
There was even some discussion of organizing a
club, of which I was to be the president, my term of
office to continue until I could sell the car to some
one else.</p>

<p>When I announced that I meant to drive to
Panama&mdash;down through Mexico, Guatemala, Salvador,
Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and any
other republics which I might discover along the
way&mdash;every one who heard of the idea offered encouragement:</p>

<p>“You’ve got the right car for <em>that</em> trip, my boy.
Since you’ll find no roads down there, you’ll need a
companion to walk ahead and chop down the cactus
or level off the mountains, and if you step hard on
the gas, you’ll just about be able to keep up with
him.”</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>I suspected that there was an element of insincerity
in this encouragement.</p>

<p>I was rather young, however, at the time of that
first venture at foreign travel. It was only a few
months after the Armistice, and I felt disinclined to
return to cub-reporting on a daily newspaper.
I elected myself to the loftier-sounding profession
of Free-Lance Newspaper Correspondent. I purchased
a palm-beach suit and an automatic pistol.
I was going south into the land of romance&mdash;of
tropical moons glimpsed through whispering palm-trees&mdash;of
tinkling guitars echoing through Moorish
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patios</i>&mdash;of black-eyed <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señoritas</i> and red-nosed soldiers
of fortune&mdash;of all the many things beyond the
ken of mere cub-reporters.</p>

<p>Despite the encouragement, I tacked my banner to
the back of my car, and set out upon a round of
farewells.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>My departure was very dramatic.</p>

<p>Men shook hands with an air of finality. Two or
three girls kissed me good-by with conventional
little pecks that seemed to say, “I’ll never see the
poor devil again, so I may as well waste some osculation
on him.”</p>

<p>I had made the entire circuit, until there remained
only a couple of village school-marms, who happened&mdash;most
unfortunately&mdash;to live on top of the
highest hill in town. Half-way to the summit, I perceived
that my car was never destined to climb that
hill. It slackened speed. It stopped. It commenced
to roll backward. I was forced to throw it into reverse,
just as the school-marms appeared in their
doorway. The situation was humiliating. I became
slightly flustered. I meant to step on the brake, but
I stepped on the gas.</p>

<p>Wherefore, after some one had picked me out of
the débris, I started southward by train.</p>

<small>BANDITS!</small>
</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>I crossed the border at daybreak.</p>

<p>In the manner of a Gringo who first passes
the Mexican frontier, I walked cautiously,
glancing behind me from time to time, anticipating
hostility, if not actual violence.</p>

<p>In the dusk of early morning the low, flat-roofed
adobe city of Nogales assumed all the forbidding
qualities of the fictional Mexico. But the leisurely
immigration official was polite. The customs’ inspector
waved me through all formalities with one
graceful gesture. No one knifed me in the back.
And somewhere ahead, beyond the dim line of railway
coaches, an engineer tolled his bell. The train,
as though to shatter all foreign misconceptions of
the country, was about to depart on scheduled time!</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Somewhat surprised, I made a rush for the ticket
window.</p>

<p>A native gentleman was there before me. He
also was buying passage, but since he was personally
acquainted with the agent, it behooved him&mdash;according
to the dictates of Spanish etiquette&mdash;to converse
pleasantly for the next half hour.</p>

<p>“And your <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señora</i>?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Gracias! Gracias!</i> She enjoys the perfect
health! And your own most estimable <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señora</i>?”</p>

<p>“Also salubrious, thanks to God!”</p>

<p>“I am gratified! Profoundly gratified! And the
little ones? When last I had the pleasure to see you,
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">chiquitita</i> was suffering from&mdash;”</p>

<p>The engineer blew his whistle. A conductor called,
“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Vamonos!</i>” I jumped up and down with Gringo
impatience. The Mexican gentleman gave no indication
of haste. The engineer might be so rude
as to depart without him, but <em>he</em> would not be hurried
into any omission of the proper courtesies. His
dialogue was closing, it is true, but closing elaborately,
still according to the dictates of Spanish etiquette,
in a handshake through the ticket window,
in an expression of mutual esteem and admiration,
in eloquent wishes to be remembered to everybody
in Hermosillo&mdash;enumerated by name until it sounded
like a census&mdash;in another handshake, and finally in
a long-repeated series of “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Adios!</i>” and “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Que le
vaya bien!</i>”</p>

<p>What mattered it if all the passengers missed the
train? Would there not be another one to-morrow?
This, despite the railway schedule, was the land of
“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Mañana</i>.”</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>On his first day in Mexico, the American froths
over each delay. In time he learns to accept it with
fatalistic calm.</p>

<p>As it happened, the dialogue ceased at the right
moment. Every one caught the train. Another
polite Mexican gentleman cleared a seat for me, and
I settled myself just as Nogales disappeared in a
cloud of dust, wondering why any train should start
at such an unearthly hour of the morning.</p>

<p>The reason soon became obvious. The time-table
had been so arranged in order that the engineer
could maintain a comfortable speed of six miles an
hour, stop with characteristic Mexican sociability at
each group of mud huts along the way, linger there
indefinitely as though fearful of giving offense by
too abrupt a departure, and still be able to reach his
destination&mdash;about a hundred miles distant&mdash;before
dark.</p>

<p>In those days&mdash;the last days of the Carranza
régime&mdash;trains did not venture to run at night, and
certainly not across the Yaqui desert. It was a forbidding
country&mdash;an endless expanse of brownish
sand relieved only by scraggly mesquite. Torrents
from a long-past rainy season had seamed it with
innumerable gullies, but a semi-tropic sun had left
them dry and parched, and the gnarled greasewood
upon their banks drooped brown and leafless. Even
the mountains along the horizon were gray and
bleak and barren save for an occasional giant cactus
that loomed in skeleton relief against a hot sky.</p>

</span></p>
<p class="center">IN THOSE DAYS TRAINS DID NOT VENTURE TO RUN AT NIGHT ACROSS
THE SONORA DESERT<br /></p>

<p>This was the State of Sonora, one of the richest
in Mexico, but its wealth&mdash;like the wealth of all
Mexico&mdash;was not apparent to the eye of the tourist.
The villages at which we stopped were but groups
of low adobe hovels. The dogs that slunk about each
habitation, being of the Mexican hairless breed,
were strangely in harmony with the desert itself.
And the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peons</i>&mdash;dark-faced semi-Indians, mostly
barefoot, and clad in tattered rags&mdash;seemed to have
no occupation except that of frying a few beans and
selling them to railway passengers.</p>

<p>At each infrequent station they were awaiting us.
Aged beggars stumbled along the side of the coach,
led by tiny children, to plead in whining voices for
“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">un centavito</i>”&mdash;“a little penny”&mdash;“for the love of
God!” Women with bedraggled shawls over the
head scurried from window to window, offering
strange edibles for sale&mdash;baskets of cactus fruit resembling
fresh figs&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">frijoles</i> wrapped in pan-cake-like
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tortillas</i> of cornmeal&mdash;legs of chicken floating
in a yellow grease&mdash;while the passengers leaned
from the car to bargain with them.</p>

<p>“What? Fifteen <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">centavos</i> for that stuff? <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Carramba!</i>”</p>

<p>“Ten cents then?”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“How much will you give?”</p>

<p>Both parties seemed to enjoy this play of wits, and
when, with a Gringo’s disinclination to haggle, I
bought anything at the price first stated, the venders
seemed a trifle disappointed. Everybody bought
something at each stopping-place, and ate constantly
between stations, as though eager to consume the
purchases in time to repeat the bargaining at the
next town. The journey became a picnic, and there
was a child-like quality about the Mexicans that
made it strangely resemble a Sunday-school outing
at home.</p>

<p>Although an escort of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Carranzista</i> soldiers occupied
a freight car ahead as a precaution against the
bandits which infested Mexico in those days, the
passengers appeared blandly unconcerned.</p>

</span></p>
<p class="center">AN ESCORT OF SOLDIERS OCCUPIED A FREIGHT CAR AHEAD AS A
PRECAUTION AGAINST BANDITS<br /></p>

<p>Each removed his coat, and lighted a cigarette.
From the car wall a notice screamed the Spanish
equivalent of “No Smoking,” but the conductor,
stumbling into the coach over a family of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peons</i> who
had crowded in from the second-class compartment,
merely paused to glance at the smokers, and to borrow
a light himself. Every one, with the friendliness
for which the Latin-American is unsurpassed,
engaged his neighbor in conversation. The portly
gentleman who had cleared a seat for me inquired
the object of my visit to Mexico, and listened politely
while I slaughtered his language. The conductor
bowed and thanked me for my ticket. When the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peon</i> children in the aisle pointed at me and whispered,
“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Gringo</i>,” their mother ceased feeding a
baby to “Shush!” them, their father kicked them
surreptitiously with a loose-flapping sandal, and
both parents smiled in response to my amused grin.</p>

<p>There was something pleasant and carefree about
this Mexico that proved infectious. Atop the freight
cars ahead, the escort of federal troops laid aside
their Mausers, removed their criss-crossed cartridge-belts,
and settled themselves for a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">siesta</i>. As the
desert sun rose higher, inducing a spirit of coma,
the passengers also settled themselves for a nap.
The babble of the morning gave place to silence&mdash;to
silence broken only by the fretting cry of an infant
and the steady click of the wheels as we crawled
southward, hour after hour, through the empty
wastes of mesquite.</p>

<p>And then, as always in Mexico, the unexpected
happened.</p>

<p>The silence was punctured by the staccato roar of
a machine-gun!</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>In an instant all was confusion.</p>

<p>Whether or not the shooting came from the Carranzista
escort or from some gang of bandits hidden
in the brush, no one waited to ascertain. Not a person
screamed. Yet, as though trained by previous
experience, every one ducked beneath the level of the
windows, the women sheltering their children, the
men whipping out their long, pearl-handled revolvers.
The only man who showed any sign of agitation
was my portly friend. His immense purple
sombrero had tumbled over the back-rest onto
another seat, and he was frantic until he recovered
it.</p>

<p>After the first roar of the machine-gun, all was
quiet. The fatalistic calm of the Mexicans served
only to heighten the suspense. The train had
stopped. When, a few months earlier, Yaqui Indians
had raided another express on this same line, the
guard had cut loose with the engine, leaving the passengers
to their Fate&mdash;a Fate somewhat gruesomely
advertised by a few scraps of rotted clothing half-embedded
in the desert sand. The thought that
history had repeated itself was uppermost in my
mind, and the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peon</i> on the floor beside me voiced it
also, in a fatalistic muttering of:</p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Dios!</i> They have left us! We are so good as
dead!”</p>

<p>We waited grimly&mdash;waited interminably. With
a crash, the door opened. A dozen revolvers covered
the man who entered. A dozen fingers tightened
upon a trigger. But it was only the conductor.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">No hay cuidado, señores</i>,” he said pleasantly.
“The escort was shooting at a jack-rabbit.”</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>The passengers sat up again, laughing at one
another, talking with excited gestures as they described
their sensations, enjoying one another’s
chagrin, all of them as noisy and happy as children
upon a picnic. They bought more <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">frijoles</i>, and the
feast recommenced, lasting until mid-afternoon,
when we pulled into Hermosillo, the capital of Sonora.</p>

<p>A swarm of porters rushed upon us, holding up
tin license-tags as they screamed for our patronage.
Hotel runners leaped aboard the car and
scrambled along the aisle, presenting us with cards
and reciting rapidly the superior merits of their
respective hostelries, meanwhile arguing with rival
agents and assuring us that the other fellow’s beds
were alive with vermin, that the other fellow’s food
was rank poison, and that the other fellow’s servants
would at least rob us, if they did not commit actual
homicide.</p>

<p>I fought my way through them to the platform,
where another battle-scene was being enacted.</p>

<p>Mexican friends were meeting Mexican friends.
To force a passage was a sheer impossibility. Two
of them, recognizing each other, promptly went into
a clinch, embracing one another, slapping one another
upon the back, and venting their joy in loud
gurgles of ecstasy, meanwhile blocking up the entire
platform.</p>

<p>Restraining <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Gringo</i> impatience once more, I stood
and laughed at them. In so many cases the extravagant
greetings savored of insincerity. One noticed a
flabbiness in the handclasps, a formality in the hugs,
an affectation in the shouts of “<em>Ay!</em> My friend!
How happy I am to see you!” Yet in many cases,
the demonstrations were real&mdash;so real that they
brought a peculiar little gulp into one’s throat, even
while one laughed.</p>

<p>Be they sincere or insincere, I already liked these
crazy Mexicans.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>A little brown <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cochero</i> pounced upon me
and took me aboard a dilapidated hack
drawn by two mournful-looking quadrupeds.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Hotel Americano?</i>” he inquired.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">No.</i> <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Hotel</i> distinctly <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Mejicano</i>.”</p>

<p>He whipped up his horses, and we jogged away
through narrow streets lined with the massive, fortress-like
walls of Moorish dwellings, past a tiny
palm-grown <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i> fronted by an old white cathedral,
to stop finally before a one-story structure whose
stucco was cracked and scarred, and dented with the
bullet holes of innumerable revolutions.</p>

<p>The proprietor himself, a dignified gentleman in
black, advanced to meet me. Were there rooms?
Why not, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>? Whereupon he seated himself
before an immense ledger, to pore over it with knitted
brows, stopping now and then to stare vacantly
skyward in the manner of one who solves a puzzle or
composes an epic poem.</p>

<p>“Number sixteen,” he finally announced.</p>

<p>“Occupied,” said a servant.</p>

<p>Another period of intellectual absorption.</p>

<p>“Number four.”</p>

<p>There being no expostulation, a search ensued for
the key. It developed that Room Number Four was
opened by Key Number Seven, which&mdash;in conformity
to some system altogether baffling to a Gringo&mdash;was
usually kept on Peg Number Thirteen, but had been
misplaced by some careless servant. The little proprietor
waved both hands in the air.</p>

<p>“What <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mozos</i>!” he exclaimed. “No sense of
orderliness whatsoever!”</p>

<p>A prolonged search resulted, however, in its discovery,
and the proprietor himself led the way back
through a succession of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patios</i>, or interior gardens,
the front ones embellished with orange trees, and
the rear ones with rubbish barrels, to Room Number
Four, from which the lock had long ago been
broken.</p>

<p>It was a large apartment, with brick floor. It contained
a canvas cot, a wobbly chair, and an aged
bureau distinguished for its sticky drawers, an air
of lost grandeur, and a burnt-wood effect achieved
by the cigarette butts of many generations of guests.
The bare walls were ornamented only by a placard,
containing a set of rules&mdash;printed in wholesale quantities
for whatever hotels craved the enhanced dignity
of elaborate regulations&mdash;proclaiming, among
other things, that occupants must comport themselves
with strict morality.</p>

<p>“One of our very choicest rooms, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>,” smiled
the proprietor, as he withdrew. “It has a window.”</p>

<p>A window did improve it.</p>

<p>From the narrow street outside came the soft
voices of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peons</i>, the sing-song call of a lottery-ticket
vender, the tread of sandaled feet, the clatter of
hoofs from a passing burro train laden with bullion
from distant mines, the guttural protesting cry
of the drivers, all in the exotic symphony of a foreign
land.</p>

<p class="center space-above"><span class="figcenter" id="i_005">

</span></p>
<p class="center">A BURRO TRAIN LADEN WITH BULLION FROM THE MINES<br /></p>

<p>Yet there was a calm, subdued note about the
chorus. In Mexico, a newly arrived Gringo expected
melodrama. It was disconcerting to find only peace.</p>

<p>An Indian maiden, straight as an arrow, swung
past with the flat-footed stride of the shoeless classes,
balancing an earthenware jar upon her dark head.
A fat old lady cantered by upon a tiny donkey,
perched precariously upon the extreme stern. A
little brown runt of a man staggered past under a
gigantic wooden table. Another staggered past
under the influence of alcohol. Women on their way
to market stopped to offer me their wares. Did I
wish to buy a chicken or a watermelon? Would I
care for a bouquet of yucca lilies? Or an umbrella?
If not an umbrella, a second-hand guitar?</p>

<p>“No?” They seemed surprised and disappointed.
But they smiled politely. “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Gracias</i> just the same,
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>! <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Adios!</i>”</p>

<p>An ice cream vender made his rounds with a slap
of leather sandals, balancing atop his <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">sombrero</i> a
dripping freezer. He stopped before a patron to
dish the slushy mixture into a cracked glass, pushing
it off the spoon with a dirty finger, and licking the
spoon clean before he dropped it back into the can.
From one pocket he produced bottles and poured
coloring matter over the concoction&mdash;scarlet, green,
and purple. Then he swung his burden aloft, and
continued on his way, chanting, “I carry snow! I
carry snow!”</p>

<p>Even the cries of a peddler were soft and gentle
here. I was about to turn from the window, when
around the corner came a strange procession of
mournful men and wailing women, led by three coffins
balanced, like every other species of baggage in this
country, upon the heads of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peons</i>. Mexico was
Mexico after all! Here was evidence of melodrama!
Excitedly I hailed the proprietor.</p>

<p>“A bandit attack, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>? No, indeed. José Santos
Dominguez had a christening at his house last
night. Purely a family affair, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>! Nothing
more.”</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>After the dusty railway journey I craved a bath.</p>

<p>From a doorway across the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i> a legend beckoned
with the inscription of “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Baños</i>.” I called an
Indian servant-maid, pointed at the legend, struggled
with Spanish, and finally secured a towel. The
bath-room door, like that of my room, had long ago
lost its lock. Searching among the several tin cans
which littered one corner, I found a stick which evidently
was used for propping against the door by
such bathers as desired privacy. Having undressed,
I leaped jubilantly into the huge, old-fashioned tub,
and turned on the water. There <em>was</em> no water.
Poking modest head and shoulders around the edge
of the door, I looked for the maid. She eventually
made her appearance, as servants will, even in
Mexico, and regarded me suspiciously from a safe
distance.</p>

<p>“No, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>, there is no water. You asked for a
towel. You did not mention that you wished also a
bath.”</p>

<p>“Well, for the love of Mike, when&mdash;”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Mañana, señor.</i> Always in the morning there is
water.”</p>

<p>And so, after supper and a stroll in the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>, I
retired, still coated with Sonora desert, to my room.
There was some difficulty in locating the electric
button, since another careless <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mozo</i> had backed the
bureau against it. There was also some difficulty in
arranging the mosquito net over my bed. It hung
from the ceiling by a slender cord which immediately
broke in the pulley. I piled a chair on top of a cot,
climbed up and mended the string, climbed down and
lowered the net to the proper height, unfolded it, and
discovered that it was full of gaping holes through
which not only a mosquito but possibly a small
ostrich could have flown with comfort and security.
Finally, beginning to feel that the charm of Mexico
had been vastly overrated by previous writers, I
retired, prepared to fight mosquitos, and discovered
that there <em>were</em> no mosquitos in Hermosillo.</p>

<p>In the morning, rejuvenated and reënergized, I
again waylaid the Indian servant-maid.</p>

<p>“Ah!” she exclaimed, as though it were a new
idea. “The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i> wishes a bath? Why not? <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Momentito!
Momentito!</i>”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Momentito</i>” is Spanish for “Keep your shirt
on!” or “Don’t raise hell about it!” or more literally
“In the tiny fraction of a moment!” It suggests
to the native mind a lightning-like speed, even
more than does “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Mañana</i>.”</p>

<p>And eventually I did get the bath. There was
some delay while the water was heated, and more
delay while the maid carried it, a kettleful at a time,
from the kitchen to the bath-room, but the last kettle
was ready by the time the rest had cooled, and I
finally emerged refreshed, to discover again that in
Mexico the unexpected always happens.</p>

<p>When I pulled out the old sock used as a stopper,
the water ran out upon the bath-room floor, and disappeared
down a gutter, carrying with it the shoes
I had left beside the tub.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>But Hermosillo possessed a charm which even a
Mexican bath could not destroy.</p>

<p>It was a sleepy little city, typically Mexican, basking
beneath a warm blue sky. It stood in a fertile
oasis of the desert, and all about it were groves of
orange trees. Its massive-walled buildings had once
been painted a violent red or green or yellow, but
time and weather had softened the barbaric colors
until now they suggested the tints of some old Italian
masterpiece. And although ancient bullet holes
scarred its dwellings, there hung over the Moorish
streets to-day a restful atmosphere of tranquillity.</p>

<p>At noon the merchants closed their shops, and
every one indulged in the national <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">siesta</i>. The only
exception was an American&mdash;a quiet, determined-looking
man&mdash;who kept walking up and down the
hotel <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i> with quick, nervous tread.</p>

<p>“Somebody just down from the States?” I asked
the proprietor.</p>

<p>“No, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>. He is the manager of mines in the
Yaqui country. One of his trucks is missing, and
he fears lest Indians have attacked it.”</p>

<p>Such a contingency, in sleepy Hermosillo, sounded
quite absurd. It was the most peaceful-appearing
town in all the world. As the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">siesta</i> hour drew to a
close, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señoritas</i> commenced to show themselves,
dressed and powdered for their evening stroll in the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>. They were dainty, feminine creatures, not
always pretty, yet invariably with a gentle womanliness
that gave them charm. Upon the streets they
passed a man with modestly downcast head. Behind
the bars of a window and emboldened by a sense of
security, they favored him with a roguish smile
from the depths of languorous dark eyes, and sometimes
with a softly murmured, “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Adios!</i>”</p>

<p>I drifted toward the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>, wondering how a Free-Lance
Newspaper Correspondent were to earn a living
in any country so outwardly unexciting as
Mexico, and dropped disgustedly into a bench beside
another young American.</p>

<p>He was a rosy-cheeked, cherubic-appearing lad.
He wore horn-rimmed spectacles, and his neatly-plastered
hair was parted in the middle. Like myself,
he was dressed in a newly purchased palm-beach
suit. His name was Eustace. He, too, was
just out of the army. He had enlisted, he explained,
in the hope that he might live down
a reputation as a model youth. And the War
Department had given him a tame job on the Mexican
border, cleaning out the cages of the signal-corps
pigeons. Wherefore he was now journeying into
foreign fields in the hope of satisfying himself with
some mild form of adventure.</p>

<p>Very solemnly we shook hands.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t quite go back to cub-reporting,” he
explained. “So I decided to become a free-lance
newspaper correspondent.”</p>

<p>Even more solemnly we shook hands again. Since
neither of us actually expected that any editor would
publish what we sent him, we formed a partnership
upon the spot. The Expedition had a new recruit.
And together we mourned the disappointing peacefulness
of Hermosillo.</p>

<p>Evening descended upon the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>. A circle of
lights appeared around the rickety little bandstand.
An orchestra played. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señoritas</i> strolled past
us, arm in arm, while stately <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Dons</i> and solemn <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Doñas</i>
maintained a watchful chaperonage from the
benches. The night deepened. The cathedral clock
struck ten. <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Dons</i>, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Doñas</i>, and <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señoritas</i> disappeared
in the direction of home. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gendarmes</i> alone remained.
Each muffled his throat as a precaution
against night air, and each set a lantern in the center
of a street crossing. From all sides came the sound
of iron bars sliding into place behind heavy doors.
Hermosillo was going to bed.</p>

<p>As we, also, turned homeward, our footsteps rang
loudly through the silent streets. A policeman unmuffled
his throat and bade us “Good night.” Then
he produced a tin whistle and blew a melancholy
little toot, to inform the policeman on the next corner
that he was still awake. From <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gendarme</i> to <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gendarme</i>
the signal passed, the plaintive wail seeming
to say, “All’s well.”</p>

<p>A beggar huddled in a doorway hid his cigarette
beneath his ragged blanket at our approach, and held
out his hand. A lone wayfarer, lingering upon the
sidewalk before a window, turned to glance at us,
and to bid us “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Adios</i>.” Through the bars a girl’s
radiant face shone out of the darkness. Then the
man’s voice trailed after us, singing very softly to
the throbbing of a guitar. A moon peeped over the
edge of the low flat roofs&mdash;a very aged and battered-looking
moon, with a greenish tinge like that of the
old silver bells in Hermosillo’s ancient cathedral&mdash;a
moon which, like the city below it, suggested that
it once had known troublous days, yet was now at
perfect peace.</p>

<p>This was a delightful land, but to a pair of Free-Lance
Newspaper Correspondents&mdash;</p>

<p>As we entered the wide-arched portals of the
hotel, the telephone struck a jarring note. The
American mining man, still pacing nervously up and
down the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i>, leaped to the receiver.</p>

<p>“Laughlin speaking! What news? Did they&mdash;?
Shot them both? White and Garcia both? Get the
troops out! I’ll be there in just&mdash;”</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>In an instant Eustace and I were at his elbow.</p>

<p>Ours was the newspaperman’s unsentimental
eagerness, which might have hailed the burning of
an orphan asylum with its four hundred helpless
inmates as splendid front-page copy. Here was
murder! This was Mexico! <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Viva Mexico!</i> Here
was our first story!</p>

<p>“No time to talk!” snapped Laughlin. “I’ll
send John Luy for you in the morning. He’ll take
you to La Colorada, in the Yaqui country itself.
You’ll get the dope there!”</p>

<p>And he vanished down the street. We stood at
the hotel gate, a little startled, gazing out into the
night. The moon smiled down over low, flat roofs,
and a man’s voice drifted to us, singing very softly
to the throbbing of a guitar, and the plaintive note
of a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gendarme’s</i> whistle seemed to say, “All’s well.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<small>AMONG THE YAQUI INDIANS</small></h2>
</div>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>John Luy met us in an elderly Buick early the
next morning.</p>

<p>He was a stocky man in khaki and corduroy,
a man of fifty or sixty, with slightly gray hair, and
the keen, friendly eyes of the Westerner. He was a
trifle deaf from listening to so many revolutions, and
questions had to be repeated.</p>

<p>“Heh? Oh, the holes in the wind-shield? They’re
only bullet holes.”</p>

<p>He motioned us into the back seat, grasped the
wheel, and drove us out through the suburbs of Hermosillo
into the open desert. The road was nothing
more than the track of cars which had crossed the
plains before us. Sometimes it led through wide
expanses of dull reddish sand; sometimes the cactus
and mesquite grew in thorny forests up to the very
edge of the narrow trail.</p>

<p>It was a country alive with all the creeping, crawling
things that supply local color for magazine fiction.
Swift brown lizards shot from our path, starting
apparently at full speed, and zigzagging through
the yucca like tiny streaks of lightning. Chipmunks
and ground squirrels dived into their burrows at our
approach. A rattler lifted its head, hissed a warning,
and retired with leisurely dignity. Jack-rabbits
popped up from nowhere in particular and scampered
into the brush, laying their ears flat against
the head, running a dozen steps and finally bouncing
away in a series of long, frantic leaps. Chaparral
cocks, locally known as road-runners, sped along the
trail before us, keeping about fifty feet ahead of the
car, wiggling their tails in mocking challenge, slackening
their pace whenever we slackened ours, speeding
whenever we speeded, and shooting away into the
mesquite in a low, jumping flight as John stepped on
the gas.</p>

<p>Now and then we passed a mound of rocks surmounted
by a crude wooden cross, and once we saw
the wreck of what had been another automobile.</p>

<p>“Heh?” asked John. “Oh! Graves. People shot
by Yaqui Indians. Oh, yes, quite a few of them.
Quite a few.”</p>

<p>He gave the wheel a twist, and we plunged down
a steep slope into a deep, sandy river-bed. The car
lumbered through it, sinking to the hubs. In the
very center it came to an abrupt stop. John picked
up a rifle.</p>

<p>“One of you lads take the gun and lay out in the
brush. This is the kind of place where White got
<em>his</em>.”</p>

<p>Eustace seized the weapon, and crawled into the
cactus, while I worked savagely to dig the wheels
from their two-foot layer of soft, beach-like sand.
John, puffing complacently at his corn-cob pipe, tried
the self-starter again and again without success,
meanwhile giving me the details of White’s murder:</p>

<p>“It was an arroyo exactly like this one. Exactly
like this one. He come around a bend in his truck,
and hit the waterhole, and was plowing through it
when a dozen Mausers blazed out’n the cactus.
Three bullets hit him square in the head. Maybe
Garcia, his mechanic, got it on the first volley, too.
You couldn’t be sure&mdash;so the fellows said over the
telephone. The Yaquis had cut him up and shoved
sticks through him ’til his own mother couldn’t’ve
recognized him. Dig the sand away from that other
wheel, will you?”</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>I breathed more freely half an hour later, when
we climbed the farther bank of the river-course, and
rattled on again, through ever-thickening forests
of cactus, to the low adobe city of La Colorada.</p>

<p>John showed us a nondescript mud dwelling that
passed for a hotel, and we presently sallied therefrom,
with paper and pencil, fully convinced that the
pleasantest method of securing copy would be that
of sitting on the village hitching post and listening
to the experiences of some one else.</p>

<p>There were half a dozen other Americans in La
Colorada. It had once been the home of gold mines
from which heavily-guarded mule trains carried
away a hundred and eight millions of dollars in bullion,
but revolutionists had destroyed the machinery
during the turbulent years that led up to the Carranza
régime, and the town now served only as a
depot for the big motor trucks which ran through
hostile Yaqui country to mines farther in the interior.
The half dozen Americans were the drivers
of these trucks. The eldest of them was under thirty,
but most of them had knocked about the far corners
of the earth since childhood, and all of them surveyed
with undisguised contempt the little thirty-two-caliber
automatics we carried.</p>

<p>“If you was to shoot me with one of them things,
and I was ever to find it out,” said Dugan, a lad of
twenty, “I’d be downright peeved about it.”</p>

<p>Dugan stood over six feet in height. His jaw resembled
the Rock of Gibraltar, and his hair suggested
Vesuvius in eruption. His favorite literature,
I suspected, was the biography of Jesse James.
He carried a forty-four in a soft-leather holster cut
wide to facilitate a quick draw. His great ambition
was to “shoot up” a saloon, and since there was no
bar-room in La Colorada, he had recently compromised
upon the local drug-stores, and had blazed
holes through the pharmacist’s castor-oil bottles.</p>

<p>All of these youths had encountered the Yaquis.
One showed us a dozen bullet-dents in his truck,
mementos of a brush with Indians on his last trip.
Another had been captured, stripped of his clothing,
and chased naked back to town. But of the latest
incident&mdash;the murder of White and Garcia&mdash;they
could give us little information. W. E. Laughlin
was supposed to have an understanding with the
Yaqui chiefs whereby his property and his employees
were protected.</p>

<p>“He pays ’em so much a year to leave him alone.
He’s never had any trouble before this. A year ago
one of his drivers was shot&mdash;Al Farrel&mdash;but it
wasn’t Yaquis. It was a gang of Mexican soldiers.
They robbed the truck and blamed it on the Indians,
and went scouting all over the country pretending to
chase the guys that did it. Maybe the same thing
has happened again.”</p>

<p>“That’s about it,” echoed another. “The Yaquis
hold us up, but it’s the Greasers they’ve got it in for.
We get off light&mdash;usually. They just rob us. When
they catch a Mex, they rip his clothes off and chuck
him into the cactus, or cut the soles off his feet and
make him dance on the hot sand.”</p>

<p>But the others disagreed. It was merely border
tradition that the Yaquis treated Americans better
than Mexicans. There was the case of Otto, the
draft-dodger, who came to La Colorada to avoid the
war, only to be caught by the Indians and tortured to
death. There was the story of One-Legged Joe,
who went prospecting just outside of town, and of
whom nothing was found except the wooden leg,
charred with fire. And there was the tragedy of
Pedro Lehr, who left his ranch near Hermosillo for
a few hours, and returned to find his entire family
slain, with the exception of a sixteen-year-old daughter
whom the Yaquis had carried away with them.</p>

<p>Pleased at our eager interest, the truck-drivers
warmed toward us. Only Dugan remained aloof,
grinning a trifle contemptuously. Eustace turned to
him:</p>

<p>“What can <em>you</em> tell us?”</p>

<p>“What do you want to know?”</p>

<p>“Well, for a starter, how do you feel when you
ride through hostile Indian country on a truckload
of dynamite?”</p>

<p>Dugan spat eloquently upon the ground. Then
he pointed toward two loaded trucks that stood in
the road before us.</p>

<p>“MacFarlane over there is going out to a mine
to-morrow. If you want to know how it feels, go
along with him. He’s carrying six hundred pounds
of dynamite.”</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Since he put it <em>that</em> way, we sought out MacFarlane.</p>

<p>He was a tall, lean-faced man&mdash;one of the quiet,
self-possessed, determined-looking mine superintendents
usually encountered in Mexico. He was
about to make a week’s trip to <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">El Progresso</i> mine,
sixty miles farther in the interior. He would be glad
to take us along.</p>

<p>And at dawn the following day, we rode out of
La Colorada in one of MacFarlane’s trucks. We
sat upon a miscellaneous assortment of machinery,
provisions, and blasting powder, with a crew of
twenty hired gunmen, each of whom wore several
hundred yards of cartridge belt draped around his
waist and criss-crossed over his shoulders in the
approved Mexican style.</p>

<p>The desert seemed a trifle more forbidding than
the one we had crossed the day before. When we
were in the open our gunmen laughed and chatted
together; when we approached the forests of yucca
and mesquite, I noticed that they grew silent and
watchful. But no sound came from the vast expanse
of wasteland except the peaceful song of the locusts.</p>

<p>At rare intervals we passed a native village&mdash;a
cluster of mud hovels surrounding an aged white
church&mdash;and our advent created a sensation. A host
of mongrel dogs but slightly removed from the
coyote stage hailed us with furious yelps. Children
raced barefoot beside the trucks to get a better view
of us. Half-naked Indian women, pounding clothes
upon the flat rocks beside a shallow brook, ceased
their work to stare at us. Even the adult male population,
reclining against the shady side of the adobe
dwellings, sat up to look at us.</p>

<p class="center space-above"><span class="figcenter" id="i_007">

</span></p>
<p class="center">INDIAN WOMEN, POUNDING CLOTHES UPON THE ROCKS BESIDE A
SHALLOW BROOK, CEASED THEIR WORK TO STARE<br /></p>

<p>There was something in these tiny hamlets that recalled
pictures of the Holy Land. Civilization had
changed but little here since the days of the Aztecs,
and despite the excitement caused by our passage,
there was an air of sleepiness about the whole place
which suggested another continent, a million miles
farther from Broadway. So perfect was the scene
that I resented the sight of a Standard Oil tin used
as a water-jar, and felt distinctly offended when I
heard the click of a Singer sewing machine issuing
from a tiny, cactus-roofed hut.</p>

<p>The natives here showed little Spanish ancestry.
Their features were purely Indian. A few, by their
prominent cheek-bones and dark complexion, suggested
a trace of Yaqui blood, but most of them were
of other tribes, and all carried arms as a precaution
against Yaqui raids. Every one wore a large knife,
and in an open-air barber shop one native with a
six-shooter on his belt was shaving another who
held a rifle across his knees. All of them greeted
us with the cry:</p>

<p>“Have you met any Yaquis?”</p>

<p>The day passed without incident, however, and
nightfall brought us to our first stopping-place, the
village of Matape, another cluster of mud hovels surrounding
an ancient white church.</p>

<p>A buxom Indian woman, who operated a hotel on
those rare occasions when visitors came to town,
served us <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">frijoles</i> and <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tortillas</i>&mdash;beans and cornmeal
pancakes&mdash;and produced from its hiding place
a bottle of fiery <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mescal</i>. Later, when we had consumed
the meal by the light of a flickering oil lamp,
her daughter joined us with a guitar, and while MacFarlane
watched his gunmen to see that no one kept
the bottle too long inverted over his black moustachios,
the girl sang to us. Still later, after she herself
had sampled the potent Mexican liquor, she
danced. She was rather comely, in a stolid Indian
way, but she was much too heavy and graceless for
complete success as a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">danseuse</i>, even after two swigs
of such inspiring stuff as <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mescal</i>. The gunmen, however,
found it highly diverting. They pushed back
their chairs to clear a stage for her, and watched her
with the pleased expression which a Mexican always
wears when looking at a woman. The guitar
twanged a weird, savage melody; the dim light from
the swinging lantern shone upon a sea of dark faces,
and reflected from a score of gleaming eyes; in the
center of the crowded room the girl danced awkwardly,
her bare feet pounding monotonously upon
the mud floor.</p>

<p>As she finally sank, flushed and panting, upon a
bench, her mother favored us with a toothless grin:</p>

<p>“For one hundred dollars gold I sell her!”</p>

<p>Eustace shook his head.</p>

<p>“She’s scarcely an essential part of a newspaper
correspondent’s equipment.”</p>

<p>“Seventy-five!” persisted the woman.</p>

<p>“That’s a special rate,” exclaimed MacFarlane.
“She lacks one ear. They say her last husband
bit it off before chasing her home with a club. Of
course, you can’t believe everything you hear. But
you’d better turn in. To-morrow we travel on muleback.”</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The trucks were to continue, with the guard, by
the longer road to the mine. MacFarlane and ourselves,
with two of the gunmen, were to ride over the
mountains. The bridle trail led through questionable
territory, but it was shorter.</p>

<p>Neither Eustace nor I had ever ridden a mule
before. Both of us had read Western fiction, and
had noted that the hero not only loved his steed, but
left nearly everything to the animal’s good judgment,
and that the noble beast, appreciating and reciprocating
his master’s affection and trust, invariably
anticipated his every wish, and carried the hero
out of every conceivable difficulty.</p>

<p>We had just discussed the matter, and had determined
to encourage the same fond relationship with
our prospective mounts, when MacFarlane rode up
to the hotel with the five most woebegone-looking
specimens of quadrupeds that we had ever seen.</p>

<p>“Cut a good big stick,” he advised.</p>

<p>Two minutes after mounting, I welcomed the suggestion.
It seemed inhuman to beat anything so
small as that mule, but the animal appeared not to
mind it in the least. The moment I ceased whaling
him, he assumed that this was where I wished to
stop. His one virtue was that no matter how often
he stumbled on the edge of a precipice, he never fell
over.</p>

<p>“When you come to a tight place,” warned MacFarlane,
“let the mule use his own judgment.”</p>

<p>And there were plenty of tight places. Hour after
hour the path twisted through narrow ravines, along
deep water-courses strewn with bowlders, down
sandy embankments where the animals slid like
toboggans, around narrow cliffs, and up sharp inclines
where they fairly leaped from rock to rock.
It was a gloriously desolate country, hideous perhaps,
yet awesome in its ugly grandeur. Mountains
reared themselves above the trail, covered sometimes
with huge candelabra cactus, but usually bare
and towering skyward like the battlements of a
gigantic fortress. So fascinating was the whole
panorama that four of us rode across a valley a full
mile in length before we discovered that Eustace had
disappeared.</p>

<p>MacFarlane stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>“Good Lord! I told him to keep close to us! Four
months ago one of my men dropped behind, and they
nabbed him so quietly we never heard a sound!”</p>

<p>He was off his mule in an instant, and leading
the way on foot, revolver in hand, while I followed
at his heels, both of us crouching behind bowlders as
we hurried back along the path we had traversed.
Turning a bend, we found Eustace sitting on his
mule at the top of a sandy decline, complacently
smoking a cigar.</p>

<p>“What the devil are you doing?” snapped MacFarlane.</p>

<p>“Tight place,” said Eustace. “I’m letting the
mule use his own judgment.”</p>

<p>“Hell!” growled MacFarlane. “The mule’s gone
to sleep!”</p>

<p>And throughout the day he lectured us upon the
fallacies of the S.P.C.A. spirit as applied to Mexican
mules, all the way to Suaqui de Batuc, another mud-village
at the junction of the Yaqui and Moctezuma
Rivers, where we were to spend another night.</p>

<p>There was no hotel in this town, but we found
lodgings with an Indian family. A woman brought
us the inevitable <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">frijoles</i> and <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tortillas</i>, gave us water
to drink which tasted as though it had been inhabited
by frogs, and ushered us to one large bed which undoubtedly
<em>was</em> inhabited by everything except frogs.
The name of the town, I learned, when translated
from the Indian, meant something which could be
printed only in French. As I scratched myself to
sleep, I reflected upon the appropriateness of the
name. I had just succeeded in closing my eyes
when a volley of pistol shots sounded outside the
window. Eustace and I bumped heads in a frantic
dive to locate the automatics beneath our pillow.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” said MacFarlane. “It’s a gang
of drunks. This is a Saint’s Day, and the faithful
are celebrating.”</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>In the morning, before continuing the journey, I
set out to secure a few photographs.</p>

<p>“Ask permission before you snap a native,” the
mining man warned me. “Some of them are superstitious&mdash;have
an idea that they’ll die within a year
if you take their picture. They killed the last photographer
that tried it.”</p>

<p>So I took special pains to ask permission. Invariably
they said, “No!” Some appeared to regard
the camera as a new species of machine-gun. Even
those who knew what it was were reticent about
posing. The more picturesque the native, and the
more I wished his picture, the more resolutely he
said, “NO!”</p>

<p>Strolling some distance from town, I finally discovered
an aged squaw who looked as though she
might die within a year even though her photograph
were not taken. But her “NO!” was not merely in
capital letters but in type larger than the largest in
a Hearst newspaper. Still, I could not resist that
picture. She was standing in the center of the
shallow river, filling deer-skin water-sacks and loading
them upon the back of a moth-eaten little burro.
But since the sun shone directly in my lens, I had to
pass her. And the moment I unslung my camera,
she started to walk upstream directly into the light.
The faster <em>I</em> walked, the faster <em>she</em> walked. I broke
into a trot, and she broke into a trot, dragging the
burro after her, and splashing water over the two
of us. I felt a trifle undignified, but I had determined
to have that picture, and I increased my pace to a
run. Thereupon she gathered her skirts about her
waist and sprinted like an intercollegiate champion.</p>

<p>From the village behind us came a series of war-whoops.
I looked back to see the entire population
joining in the chase. Suddenly I realized that my
behavior <em>was</em> undignified. Some fifty angry natives
were rushing toward me, waving in the air an assortment
of weapons that might have delighted a collector
of antiques, but which at the moment gave me
no cause whatsoever for rejoicing. I stopped and
faced them, trying vainly to explain my conduct in
my inadequate Spanish, while they shook their fists,
and waved knives in the air, and jabbered furiously.</p>

<p>Eustace came to my rescue. Two years and eight
sweethearts upon the border had given him a fluent
command of the language.</p>

<p>“They’ve misjudged your intentions,” he chuckled,
after he had calmed the mob. “I’ve explained
it all. This old geezer with the four whiskers on his
chin is her man, and he says he’ll let you take her
picture for two pesos. I suppose he’s tired of her,
and doesn’t care whether she croaks or not.”</p>

<p>But the squaw evidently valued her life at more
than two pesos. For she gathered up her skirts once
more, and fled away down the river, dragging the
burro behind her.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>It was but a few hours’ ride from Suaqui to <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">El
Progresso</i> Mine. It lay in the center of a ragged,
bowl-shaped valley in the heart of the mountains,
some ninety miles from the railroad&mdash;a group of
gaping shafts beside a stone blockhouse, with a village
of thatched laborers’ quarters straggling along
a sandy, cactus-hedged street.</p>

<p>Some half dozen American bosses occupied the
blockhouse. The native workmen numbered about
two hundred, <span id="pimas">most of them Pimas</span> and <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mestizos</i>, or
mixed-breeds.</p>

<p>“Don’t shoot at any rattlesnakes,” MacFarlane
warned us, “or you’ll see everybody dropping work
and running for headquarters to resist attack.”</p>

<p>The mine itself had never been threatened by the
Yaquis, but on several occasions they had attempted
to ambush the provision trucks. Like most of the
mines in Mexico, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">El Progresso</i> was not the sort
where one had merely to walk out with a pick and
chop large pieces of silver off a convenient mountain
side; before a single speck of mineral could be extracted,
it had been necessary to transport across
the desert a hundred thousand dollars’ worth of
machinery; every bit of it had been brought over the
long trail on truck or muleback, and the journey of
every train had meant the possibility of a fight with
Indians.</p>

<p>The Yaquis of Sonora are closely related
to the Apaches of our own border country. From
the earliest coming of the white man, they have resented
the invasion of their domain. The Spaniards
were never able to conquer them. Porfirio Diaz, who
pacified all the rest of Mexico, could never make the
Yaquis recognize the sovereignty of the Mexican
government over their territory. He sent expedition
after expedition against them, depleted their
ranks by constant warfare, and took thousands of
prisoners whom he shipped to far-off Yucatan to
labor as virtual slaves upon the henequin plantations.
But the atrocities of the Diaz soldiers merely
aggravated the Indians’ hatred of their would-be
rulers.</p>

<p>From time to time, in more recent years, groups
of Yaquis have made their peace with the Mexican
authorities. Many of them, known as “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">manzos</i>” in
distinction from the “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">bravos</i>” in the hills, are to be
found in every Sonoran village and even in Arizona.
As soldiers, they are the bravest in Mexico, and as
laborers the most industrious. But they were never
especially friendly to Carranza, and in his era,
although some served in the federal army, they
frequently did so in order to obtain arms or ammunition
for their own use. Soldiers one day, they
were apt to be bandits the next.</p>

<p>Although the Yaquis had first declared war upon
the invading white man with every possible justification,
they had been forced, through years of constant
retreat into the unfertile recesses of the desert,
to prey upon the invaders for a living. Although
their original grievance had been against the Mexican,
bandits can not be choosers. And the miners
at <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">El Progresso</i> were always on the watch.</p>

<p>“It’s a bad time just now,” one man explained.
“They all get together for a big hullabaloo every
Easter, and drink a lot of mescal, and get so enthusiastic
that they start out for a few more scalps.”</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>I had witnessed the Easter ceremony of the Yaqui
Indians before leaving the border.</p>

<p>Strange as it may sound, the Yaqui is a Christian.
Years ago the Spanish missionaries, the greatest adventurers
in all history, penetrated the Sonora desert
where warriors feared to tread, and finding themselves
unable to converse with the Indians, enacted
their message in sign language. To-day, at Easter
time, the Yaquis reënact the same story, distorted
by their own barbaric conception of it until it
is but a semi-savage burlesque upon the Passion
Play.</p>

<p>In the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">manzo</i> settlement at Nogales, the Christ
was represented by a cheap rag doll, garbed in brilliantly
colored draperies, and cradled in a wicker
basket beneath a thatched roof. The ceremonies
lasted from Good Friday until after Easter Sunday,
and during that time the Indians neither ate nor
slept, refreshing themselves only with <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mescal</i>.</p>

<p>The native conception of the life of Christ was
that of a continual warfare with Judas. To make
the odds harder for Him, they had six assistant
Judases, selected&mdash;I was told&mdash;from the young
braves who had committed the most sins during the
current year.</p>

<p class="center space-above"><span class="figcenter" id="i_008">
  <img src="images/008.jpg" class="w75"  alt="THE CHRIST WAS REPRESENTED BY A CHEAP RAG DOLL CRADLED IN
A WICKER BASKET" />
</span></p>
<p class="center">THE CHRIST WAS REPRESENTED BY A CHEAP RAG DOLL CRADLED IN
A WICKER BASKET<br /></p>

<p>“We have several,” explained an intelligent old
Indian, “because my people could not respect a
Savior who allowed himself to be licked by any one
man.”</p>

<p>The Judases appeared in startling devil masks,
and for three days they capered before the Infant,
contorting their semi-naked bodies, howling like
fiends, poking Him with sticks, spitting upon Him,
kissing Him in mockery, and challenging Him to
come out and fight. About the cradle the women
of the tribe sat cross-legged upon the ground, wailing
a strange Indian hymn that rose and fell in
plaintive minor key. A tomtom pounded monotonously.
Night descended, and the fires threw weird,
fantastic shadows upon the reddened mountain sides.
Hour after hour, and day after day, the barbaric
orgy continued, until on Easter Sunday the tribe
rose in defense of the Christ, seized the Judases and
carried them to the fire, where they pretended to
burn them. Afterwards, they carried the image of
the Savior in mournful procession to a little grave
behind the village. It was a ridiculous travesty upon
religion, yet one could not laugh. There was a solemnity
in the faces of these people, as they followed
the rag doll to its burial place. Many of the women
were weeping. The men bared their heads, and
there was true reverence in the dark, savage eyes.
The capering of the devil-dancers had been ludicrous,
yet now I found myself strangely impressed.
And, anyhow, it is inadvisable to laugh at religious
fanatics&mdash;especially if they happen to be Yaqui
Indians.</p>

</span></p>
<p class="center">FOR THREE DAYS THE INDIANS NEITHER ATE NOR SLEPT, REFRESHING
THEMSELVES ONLY WITH MESCAL<br /></p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>The same ceremony is practiced, with variations
in ritual, by the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">bravos</i> in the hills.</p>

<p>Frequently, as the miner had suggested, it serves
as a get-together for the Spring raiding season.
Spring is harvest-time in southern Sonora, and an
ideal time for the Yaquis to sweep down from the
mountains and pillage the valleys which the Mexicans
have taken from them. In the days of Carranza,
the Indians not only invaded the rural districts,
but carried their raids to the very outskirts
of Guaymas and Hermosillo.</p>

<p>Word came to us at <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">El Progresso</i> that a band of
the Indians was operating not far away. They had
attacked several of the neighboring villages, and had
visited the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Gavilan</i> Mine, another American concern
in our district, where they had done the miners
no bodily harm, but had left them without clothing
or provisions.</p>

<p>“When we start back to-morrow, we’ll travel by
night,” decided MacFarlane. “The Yaquis are
superstitious about the crosses along the trail. The
ghosts of the murdered men are supposed to be out
for revenge after dark. That’s the safest time to
travel.”</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>We left at sunset, a little party of five.</p>

<p>As we rode silently toward the vague mountains
ahead, their peaks became a magic crimson that
deepened slowly to purple against a silver sky. We
passed Suaqui, where the rivers gleamed like shining
ribbons in the last faint twilight. Then the
swift desert night was upon us, and we were riding
into a deep pass, where the air grew strangely
chill.</p>

<p>I can recall every minute of that long night. Perhaps
the mule could see the path. I couldn’t. Now
and then, as we ascended, I caught a momentary
glimpse of the rider ahead, looming abnormally large
against the sky. Usually I listened to the crunch of
hoofs upon the gravel, and followed close behind.
One had the sensation of being about to enter a tunnel
into which the other riders had disappeared.
When the faint moonlight seeped down into the pass,
it converted each cactus into the semblance of a
crouching Yaqui. And despite MacFarlane’s assertion
that night travel was comparatively safe,
neither he nor the others were taking chances. The
howl of a coyote or the cooing of a dove brought
every revolver out of its holster, for these noises,
although common enough in the mountains, are
sometimes used by the Indians as signals. Once,
when something trailed us for half a mile through
the brush, we all rode half-turned in the saddle, covering
the spot where the twigs crackled. It was
probably some animal&mdash;perhaps a mountain lion&mdash;following
us out of curiosity, but we watched it, lest
it prove a bandit.</p>

<p>Hour after hour we rode in silence through the
black defiles. We knew whether we were ascending
or descending only from the slant of the mule’s back.
The nervous strain seemed to affect even the animals.
When we paused at a mountain stream to
water them, my own beast suddenly lashed at me
with his heels, and bolted. I chased him several
hundred yards up the ragged bed of the water-course,
stumbling over slippery stones, and splashing
into the pools until I finally captured him, both
of us making enough noise&mdash;it seemed to me&mdash;to
awaken any Yaqui within a mile.</p>

<p>And within a mile, we turned a bend, and found
ourselves in the very center of an encampment! A
score of camp-fires, dwindled to smoldering red
ashes, lined the trail, and about them, as though they
were the spokes of a wheel, a group of men were
sleeping with feet toward the blaze, in Yaqui fashion,
each man with a rifle beside him. Not a sentry had
stopped us. Even as I realized where we were, I
found that my mule was stepping over the recumbent
figures.</p>

<p>One of the men awoke, yawned, and raised himself
on an elbow to stare at us.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” demanded MacFarlane in Spanish.</p>

<p>“Federal soldiers,” and the man composed himself
for another nap.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>We rode into Matape at dawn, and a truck carried
us back to La Colorada. Dugan offered his hand.</p>

<p>“I done you an injustice, pardners. I thought
you’d be scared.”</p>

<p>Eustace and I, exchanging confidences in private,
agreed that Dugan had done neither of us an injustice,
but we kept this to ourselves.</p>

<p>John Luy, driving us back to Hermosillo in his
Buick, seemed highly amused about the whole affair.
He chuckled to himself for a long time before he
spoke:</p>

<p>“It’s funny! Mack don’t usually make that ride
at night. He did it to give you guys a thrill, and I
suspect he got a thrill himself. Laughlin’s been investigating
that last murder, you know. It was
Yaquis that done it, but a bunch of Yaquis serving
as federal soldiers. Lucky they were asleep without
sentries last night when you fellows rode through.”</p>

<small>DOWN THE WEST COAST</small></h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>On the train that carried me southward from
Hermosillo I met “The General.”</p>

<p>He was young&mdash;scarcely out of his teens&mdash;slender,
mild-mannered, almost feminine in voice and
appearance. His large, dark eyes were shaded with
long, girlish lashes. One felt startled when, upon
more intimate acquaintance, he confided that he was
an ex-bandit.</p>

<p>His rank, in reality, was only that of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">teniente</i>,
than which one could not be much lower in a Mexican
army, but it pleased him so much when I first
addressed him as “General” that I continued the
practice.</p>

<p>Our meeting was accidental. Eustace and I, still
traveling together, found him in a double-seat, with
his handbags spread over whatever space he did
not fill himself. As we paused before him, he looked
up in surprise, apparently feeling that the railway
had not made proper provision for so many passengers.</p>

<p>“Pardon, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">General</i>, but is this bench reserved?”</p>

<p>He smiled. He removed his baggage most graciously.
Within half an hour he had announced himself
our humble servant, and was planning gay parties
for us at the several stopping-places ahead. He
knew all the girls along the West Coast, he said,
both respectable and otherwise. He would see that
we enjoyed the trip. He would be our guide and
mentor in things Mexican. And when we reached
Mazatlán&mdash;the southern terminus of the road, some
three or four days distant&mdash;<em>his</em> house would be <em>our</em>
house. We should attend his wedding, which was
to be celebrated immediately upon his arrival, and
if we remained long enough, we should be the godfathers
to his first child.</p>

<p>And although he impressed me as somewhat too
lavish in his promises, he proved an entertaining
companion on the long journey&mdash;a journey through
a monotonous continuation of the Sonora desert,
with stop-overs at cities which, with minor variations,
were replicas of Hermosillo&mdash;at Guaymas,
San Blas, and Culiacán&mdash;cities pleasant and interesting,
yet never so interesting to me as my first
Mexican friend, the little General.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The young <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">teniente</i> was typical in many ways not
only of the Mexicans, but of most of the Latin-Americans.</p>

<p>He lived completely in the present, with scarcely a
thought of the morrow. For him <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tempus</i> did not
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fugit</i>, save very rarely, and even then there was sure
to be more <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tempus</i> afterward.</p>

<p>He had unlimited time for friendliness and politeness.
In his friendliness he was prone to those professions
of love which to the Anglo-Saxon mind
savor of hypocrisy; in his politeness he was inclined
toward phraseology that suggested figurative
language; yet if this were hypocrisy, it was tempered
with self-deception, and the phraseology was
intended frankly as figurative language.</p>

<p>If he sometimes lacked veracity, it was because his
code of etiquette called not for the truth, but for
some statement that would give more satisfaction
than the truth. Seldom thinking beyond the immediate
present, he apparently did not reflect that an
ultimate discovery of reality might bring disappointment
greater than the original satisfaction.</p>

<p>One encounters this mental habit everywhere in
Latin America. If one inquires of a fellow-passenger
whether he is nearing his destination, he invariably
is assured that he is, although a half-day’s
journey may confront him. If one asks a hotel servant
whether laundry may be washed before to-morrow
night, he invariably learns that it may, although
the servant knows perfectly well that the laundress
will not call until the day after to-morrow.</p>

<p>In Guaymas, our first stopping-place, the General
was to meet us in the Plaza at three o’clock to take
us to visit his uncle. At about five, we bumped
into him accidentally upon the street.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Amigos!</i>” he cried delightedly, enfolding each
of us in a Latin embrace. “So glad I am to see you!
I wish to take you to visit my uncle.”</p>

<p>“You were going to do that at three.”</p>

<p>“So I was! So I was! I was on my way to the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>, but I met a friend, and we had two or three
drinks of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tequila</i>, and I forgot all about it!”</p>

<p>He spoke not in apology. He merely offered what
he considered a satisfactory explanation. To him,
as to most Mexicans, an engagement was merely a
tentative agreement, to prove binding only in the
event that neither party forget it or happen to be
doing something else at the appointed hour. He was
delightfully free from any troublesome sense of obligation.
While an Anglo-Saxon would rise each
morning, taking mental inventory of the many things
to be done during the next sixteen hours, the Mexican
solved life’s problems by merely reflecting,
“Here’s another pleasant day!”</p>

<p>Having met us upon the street, the General
promptly forgot the date he had made with some
one else, and took us to call upon his uncle. His
uncle was not at home.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>The Mexican is by nature impractical. When he
makes a promise, he usually means it. Afterwards
he discovers that he has promised something which
he can not fulfill.</p>

<p>“To-night,” said the General, “I shall arrange
a dance in your honor.”</p>

<p>And this time, he did meet us at the appointed
hour&mdash;or soon thereafter. He had with him the musicians,
two barefooted <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peons</i> with mandolin and
guitar, and we started again for his uncle’s residence.
Everything was ready for the dance except
that the uncle had not been informed that he
was to be the host, or that any such affair was to
transpire.</p>

<p>The General, however, was determined that we
should have a good time. We were duly presented
to a middle-class family of a dozen or more individuals,
all eager to be friendly, but all a trifle embarrassed.
The musicians played some dance that
had long since faded from popularity north of the
border&mdash;it was either “Smiles” or “Hindustan,”
which are still the rage in Mexico&mdash;and the General
made the rounds in search of a partner. In turn he
offered his arm to each of his cousins&mdash;three rather
shy little olive-faced girls of thirteen, fourteen, and
fifteen&mdash;while each in turn pleaded:</p>

<p>“I don’t know how to dance. I wish I did.”</p>

<p>He finally discovered a stout, middle-aged lady
who professed some slight knowledge of terpsichore,
and marched with her thrice about the room, as is
the fashion in Latin America. Then he seized her
manfully, and sped away in a two-step. The lady,
taken seemingly by surprise, did not move, and the
little General came to a sliding stop. Still determined,
he recovered his balance, and sped away in
the other direction, with the same result. There was
then a discussion as to whether this were a waltz or
not. That question being settled by the musicians,
who said it was a polka, both parties danced in the
same direction, until they had made a couple of flying
rounds, when they stopped, and the General
offered his partner to me. It was somewhat reminiscent
of putting out the ash-barrels on Monday morning,
but the lady was willing, and for the next three
hours Eustace and I and the General took turns
whirling her over the adobe floor.</p>

<p>“A little excitement like that,” said the General,
as we finally took our departure, “breaks the
monotony of life.”</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>As I came to know the Mexicans better, I discovered
that such an evening, although it impressed a
Gringo as a trifle boresome, was quite an event in
middle-class Mexican existence.</p>

<p>The Latin-American had an amazing knack of not
being bored. This, too, was a product of his mental
habit of living wholly in the present. He never
suffered from the Anglo-Saxon sense of a waste of
time; he was never afflicted with reflections about
countless other ways of spending his evening.</p>

<p>He could sit every night in the same <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>, looking
at the same faces. He could meet the same friends
day after day, and be just as pleased to see them,
and ask them the same questions about their many
relatives, and part with the same elaborate courtesies.
He could listen hour after hour with the same
enjoyment to the same pieces of music that the village
band had played for the past ten years. And
he could talk with the same neighbors about exactly
the same things again and again, and never lose his
enthusiasm either as speaker or listener.</p>

<p>After supper, at the hotels along the way, proprietor
and guests would bring their chairs to the
sidewalk, where they could see the passers-by, and
would remain there for hours, chatting with tremendous
zest about nothing at all. Inconsequential remarks,
which Americans of equal intelligence might
consider unworthy either of utterance or audience,
would be offered for popular consideration with
emphatic statement, and received almost with
applause. I recall the declaration of a young
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señorita</i> to the effect that she considered a bath very
refreshing. This bit of wisdom, which elsewhere in
the world might have been accepted as trite and obvious,
brought every member of the circle into enthusiastic
agreement. It was quite as though she
had advanced a startling new theory, which had long
been hovering vaguely in the minds of the others, but
which they now heard propounded for the first time.
It stimulated cries of “Yes, indeed!” or “You have
spoken most truly!” and the discussion lasted for
half an hour.</p>

<p>With Mexican kindliness, they always included me
in the conversation, although I spoke their language
abominably. Had a foreigner murdered English as
I murdered Spanish, I should not have had the patience
to listen to him. Yet they listened avidly,
knitting their brows sometimes in their effort to
guess the meaning. If they smiled, their smiles were
kindly. They were pleased that the foreigner should
try to learn their language. If they disliked Americans
in general, they were quickly ready to like any
individual American who would meet them half-way.
And the moment he showed a willingness to adopt
their own elaborate courtesy, they described him as
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">muy simpatico</i>&mdash;an expression that means infinitely
more than our nearest equivalent of “very sympathetic”&mdash;and
hailed him as “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">paisano</i>”&mdash;“fellow-countryman.”
And they would promise him anything.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>If at first impression, the elaborate Spanish politeness
seems boresome, it gradually seeps its way into
the soul of the average visitor so insidiously that
within two weeks he finds himself resenting the rudeness
of Americans more recently arrived than himself.</p>

<p>I met one on the train that took me out of Guaymas.</p>

<p>He was trying to tell the conductor that this passenger
coach would have been condemned long ago
in the good old U.S.A. Since the official did not understand
English, even when shouted, the newcomer
was growing a trifle peeved. He turned disgustedly
to Eustace and myself:</p>

<p>“Damn these spigs, anyway! How do they expect
anybody to come down here and do business
with them when they can’t talk like other people?”</p>

<p>He seemed out of place in Mexico. He belonged
essentially to the smoking compartment of an American
Pullman, where his counterpart can invariably
be found with thumbs beneath suspender straps, telling
the world about the big deals which his type
seems always to have “just pulled off between trains
in Detroit.”</p>

<p>In Mexico, he admitted failure. He was selling
soap&mdash;“the best grade of pure white bath soap on
the market.” But buyers were too ignorant to converse
with him in <em>his</em> language, and they showed a
ridiculous inclination to purchase the brilliant scarlet
soaps turned out by a German firm that catered
to the native love of bright color.</p>

<p>“If I’d known what they were like,” he said,
speaking loudly, “I’d have laid in a side-line of perfume
and bug powder.”</p>

<p>We suggested that some of the passengers <em>might</em>
understand English.</p>

<p>“What the hell do I care? Let ’em hear it. It’ll
do ’em good. Let the dirty greasers know what we
Americans think of ’em! Say, I’m glad I met you
fellows. I’ve been lonesome for somebody from
God’s country.”</p>

<p>He attached himself to us, and stuck like a leech.
At Culiacán, where we stopped over for a day, he
made the discovery that “whiskey” was the same in
Spanish as in English. After imbibing freely in a
little saloon kept by an elderly lady whose manners
were those of royalty, he propped his feet on the
table and expectorated with impressive accuracy
at a picture of the Madonna that hung on the wall.</p>

<p>We dragged him out, and led him toward the
hotel.</p>

<p>“What do I care about her?” he growled.
“Damned spig! Let ’er <em>call</em> a policeman. I’ll lick
ten Mexican policemen!”</p>

<p>At the hotel, after we had persuaded him not to hit
the General, he favored our friend with another discourse
on the relative prowess of Americans and
“Greasers.”</p>

<p>“Any time we get good and ready, we’ll come
down here and take this rotten republic and make
a decent place out of it! We’ll clean up your spig
army in two weeks! All you guys can do is knife
people in the back! When you have a war, you point
your rifles around the corner of a building and pull
the trigger without lookin’ where you shoot! Any
good Yank can lick ten of you&mdash;ten of you&mdash;with one
arm tied behind his back!”</p>

<p>The General’s face darkened. I watched him,
rather hoping that the slender little Mexican would
proceed to mop up the floor with the valiant soap-salesman.
Beneath his politeness, I knew, there was
a sensitive, proud nature quick to resent an insult.
Yet so ingrained were his traditions of courtesy that&mdash;even
while a tigerish gleam in his eyes betrayed
his wrath&mdash;he merely smiled.</p>

<p>“The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>,” he said, “is feeling very lively to-night.”</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>As he walked away, we feared that he had no
further use for gringos, but on the following morning,
as we sat in the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>, the General came up to
embrace us with more than his usual ardor. He was
feeling “very lively” himself. He announced that
he had been up all night, and that he was now ready
to wander over to the shady side of town to call upon
a few of the “girls.”</p>

<p>When we suggested that it was too early in the
day, and advocated rest rather than recreation, he
was agreeable, as always. He was even tractable.
He would allow us to lead him back to the hotel; at
the door he would embrace us again, promising to
go straight to bed; fifteen minutes later he would
come strolling up to us in the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>, falling upon
our necks as though it were our first meeting,
and repeating his suggestion about calling upon
the girls.</p>

<p>“How about your fiancée in Mazatlán?” Eustace
inquired.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“But she is in Mazatlán! And I am in Culiacán!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you love her?”</p>

<p>“Love her! Ah, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>, who would not love her!
So good, so pure, so true, so beautiful, so like an
angel in Heaven! For two whole years I have
dreamed of her! Throughout the two years that I
was <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Villista</i> in Chihuahua!</p>

<p>“Listen, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>. Two years ago I left Mazatlán.
She promised that she would marry me. But I was
penniless, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>. And in Mexico, the man must buy
his bride’s trousseau. I was mechanic, and I went to
Sonora to work in the mines. I was in the village of
San Pedro when the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Villistas</i> came through. Some
youths from the town fired upon the rear-guard, killing
Villa’s cousin. And Villa ordered that every
man in San Pedro should die in punishment. They
herded me with the others in the public square,
and took us out, twenty at a time, to the church wall,
where our youths were slaughtered with pistol and
machine-gun. But they spared me, for I was mechanic,
and Villa had use for mechanic.</p>

<p>“Of course, I became <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Villista</i>. Who, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>, would
not? And I fought Carranza with the others. Why
not? Who was Carranza but a general more fortunate
than Villa, who captured Mexico City, and
made himself president? I fought with Villa all
through Chihuahua. Yes, I helped to fire upon
Columbus, in your own New Mexico, but I liked
Americans, and I fired in the air. I would have
come home, but I had no money for the journey.
There came a day when we took Juarez. I was lieutenant
then. I captured a building with my men.
It was gambling house. There was gold upon the
tables, and I filled my pockets. Why not, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>?
Some one else would have taken it. I ran away from
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Villistas</i>. I rode four hundred miles&mdash;four
hundred miles, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>&mdash;through the mountains and
across the Yaqui desert.”</p>

<p>Unconsciously he struck a dramatic pose.</p>

<p>“Would I have done that, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>, if I did not love
the girl?”</p>

<p>Then he climbed into a coach, and rode away toward
a questionable destination with a gay little
wave of his hand.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>I was inclined to doubt the General’s story.</p>

<p>He was manifestly a poseur. He possessed,
among other qualities, an inordinate desire to attract
attention. He knew, for instance, that he was
handsome, and would spend hours combing his dark
hair, or powdering his face. He loved to be stared
at by the young girls in the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>. He basked in
admiration and reveled in adulation or flattery.</p>

<p>His vanity manifested itself also in a desire to
be photographed. If I wished to snap a landscape or
a street scene, Eustace had almost to hold him, lest
he arrange himself artistically in the immediate
foreground. Upon his return from the red light
district that morning, he announced that he had
promised its inmates to bring us there with our
camera for a group picture.</p>

<p>He led us to the outskirts of town to a region
where several slatternly brown females sat upon the
curb in negligée, smoking cheap cigars, and introduced
us in a speech which seemed more elaborate
than such an informal occasion required. The ladies,
surprised as Mexicans always are when some
one keeps an agreement, begged that we wait while
they beautified themselves, and we waited for over
an hour. They appeared eventually, in silk finery,
with an eighth of an inch of powder laid upon a
facial coating of glycerine.</p>

<p>Then ensued the difficulties that confront every
photographer in Latin America. They protested
against venturing into the sunlight. Sunlight would
ruin the complexion! When, in response to explanations,
they did step out from the shade, they kept
raising their hands to shelter their faces. And
finally, when we had them properly grouped with the
General in the center, some one exclaimed that she
must be holding her doll, and while she searched for
the doll, the group broke up and scurried out of the
sunlight.</p>

<p>At length, the picture being taken, they all clamored
to see it at once. To my statement that it had
to be developed by a photographer, they listened
with suspicion. Their familiarity with the itinerant
tin-type man had bred a distrust of my slow methods.
Yet they, with the politeness that extends in
Latin America even to the underworld, did not voice
the suspicion. And when, in the afternoon, we returned
with what we considered an excellent picture,
they rushed excitedly to view it.</p>

<p>There was a disappointed silence. They did not
intend to be rude, but their grief escaped them.</p>

<p>“I’m not smiling!”</p>

<p>“My face came out dark!”</p>

<p>My camera, being a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Gringo</i> camera, had insulted
them by its blunt frankness. But they tried to conceal
their disappointment. They thanked us profusely.
And they carried away the film, to destroy it
as soon as our backs were turned.</p>

<p>“You were very foolish,” said the General afterwards.
“You did not have to take a real picture.
You should have pointed the camera and clicked
something else. It would have pleased them.”</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Strangely enough, the more hypocrisy one discovered
in the little General, the more one liked him.</p>

<p>It was a hypocrisy leavened by kindliness and
humor. And to him, as to other Latin-Americans, it
was not hypocrisy at all, for his was a code of life
wherein our Anglo-Saxon standards were completely
inverted.</p>

<p>Each race has developed its own ideas as to what
is important in human conduct. The Anglo-Saxon,
being by nature blunt and frank, regards truth as a
supreme virtue. When he discovers something
wrong, he sets about correcting it. The Latin-American,
being by nature suave and courteous, regards
truth as an irritating and offensive bad habit. When
he discovers something wrong, he politely ignores
it.</p>

<p>From our viewpoint, the Latin-American appears
shallow and superficial. He lives a life of pretense,
completely satisfied so long as outward effect is
properly maintained. He lies cheerfully and gracefully
as a matter of good form. He offers one short
change with a knightly gesture. If reminded gently
that he has made an “error” in his count, he is extremely
grateful for the correction. If informed
that he has cheated, he becomes highly indignant
that his honor has been so rudely questioned. He
wears handsome clothes and shabby underwear. He
usually lets the tailor wait indefinitely for payment,
and when pressed to settle a bill, he says with impressive
dignity, “Because you insult me in your implication
that I am not to be trusted, I shall not pay
you for another month!”</p>

<p>He is inordinately fond of parading himself in
public. He deliberately caters to theatrical taste.
He is by nature no more impulsive than an Anglo-Saxon,
but upon the right occasion, since it attracts
attention and distinguishes him as a temperamental
creature, he indulges in great emotion. He makes a
wild demonstration of enthusiasm over friends. He
affects much grief over the death of his mother-in-law.
He grows furious at times, but usually in the
absence of the enemy, in the presence of an enemy
whom he believes he can lick, or under the influence
of alcohol. He is courageous enough&mdash;frequently to
a point of recklessness which the Anglo-Saxon
seldom equals&mdash;but usually when he believes the object
worth the risk, or when vanity overcomes his
judgment, to lure him into a dramatic scene before
an admiring audience.</p>

<p>He understands the shallow pretenses of his fellows,
but he accepts them as real, just as they accept
his. He professes unlimited faith and confidence in
their loyalty and integrity, although he suspects
that they can be trusted only so long as it is to their
advantage. He knows them to be&mdash;like himself&mdash;indolent,
undependable, and potentially dishonest, yet
he makes eloquent speeches to them, extolling their
energy, reliability, and general uprightness. By
<span id="hypnosis">a process of self-hypnotism, he convinces himself</span>
momentarily that he means these lavish professions.
When they respond with similar praises of
his own worth, he glows all over with a very much
gratified self-satisfaction.</p>

<p>Generalizations of this sort, I admit, are always
unjust. Out of the mass of the Latin-American
population stand many splendid individuals to
whom this character analysis does not apply. Even
in the mass, the various characteristics are subject
to variation from country to country. But on the
whole, from an Anglo-Saxon viewpoint, these people
appear idealists in speech and materialists in action.
One hand counts the rosary while the other
scratches fleas. Judged by the Anglo-Saxon, they
have few real virtues. Yet one must remember that
each race has its own standards, created out of an
unconscious desire to glorify itself by worshiping
as virtues the qualities which it happens to possess.
Judged by their own standards, their vices are virtues,
and our virtues are vices.</p>

<p>It is the Latin-American’s many faults that make
him likeable. His own defects, which he understands
but refuses to admit, have made him extremely
tolerant toward the defects of others. Being
supersensitive, he is considerate of a stranger’s
feelings. Loving flattery, he is lavish in its bestowal.
Being vain, he is eager to make a good impression,
and frequently proves generous and hospitable. Being
indolent, he has infinite leisure for entertainment.
At all times he is friendly, agreeable, and
courteous.</p>

<p>To-day, several years after my first visit to
Mexico, when I have lived among the natives of
twenty-six different lands, and met travelers from
many others, there is no people whose company I
have enjoyed more than that of the Latin-Americans.
And no one individual who proved a more
pleasant companion than the little Mexican General.</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>He was still with us when Eustace and I set out
upon the last stage of our railway journey to Mazatlán.</p>

<p>So, incidentally, was the soap-salesman.</p>

<p>The train brought us to the end of the long stretch
of desert that extended from Sonora far down into
Sinaloa. An occasional palm tree rose among the
cactus. Adobe huts gave way to structures of cane
and thatch. A delicious balminess in the air heralded
the approach of the tropics. A tang of salt
came from the Pacific breezes, and the sea itself
loomed presently before us, a glorious blue beneath
a cloudless sky.</p>

<p>The little General leaned from the window, his
eyes shining.</p>

<p>“Home! Home at last, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señores</i>!”</p>

<p>Then the eyes darkened, with a somber melancholy
that came at times into their depths. I suspected,
as often I had suspected, that he was playing his
dramatic rôle to gain our sympathy.</p>

<p>“You are worrying about the authorities?” I
asked.</p>

<p>But he spoke without effort at effect:</p>

<p>“There is danger. I have informed them of my
coming. But I can prove that Villa took me prisoner&mdash;that
I could not help myself.”</p>

<p>“The girl will be waiting for you, of course?”</p>

<p>“I have not informed <em>her</em>. It will be a surprise!
Such a surprise, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señores</i>!”</p>

<p>He did not know that she had already married a
rival. He never did know. Somewhere at the edge
of the desert, the train stopped, and a party of federal
soldiers came aboard. A <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Carranzista</i> officer
walked quickly up the aisle, scanning the faces of the
passengers. Before the little General, he paused.</p>

<p>“Ramón Vásquez?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Sí, señor.</i>”</p>

<p>“Come with me.”</p>

<p>The General rose. He was strangely calm. He
seemed suddenly to have gained in stature. There
was a quiet pride in his bearing&mdash;a poise&mdash;a distinction.
He shook hands with each of us, even with
the American who had insulted him.</p>

<p>“There is an army post here, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señores</i>. I had
hoped to go home to-night to see the girl. But it is
better, perhaps, that the investigation come first.
Remember, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señores</i>, in Mazatlán <em>my</em> house is <em>your</em>
house.”</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>There was no investigation.</p>

<p>The soldiers cast a noose about his neck, and
threw the other end over the limb of a tree. A
horseman made it fast to his saddle. For the moment,
so unbelievable was the proceeding, I was
stunned. Then, my heart pounding as though the
noose were about my own neck, I hurried with Eustace
to the scene, protesting.</p>

<p>The General smiled at us.</p>

<p>“You are good friends,” he said. “I am grateful.
But you can not help me, and you may invite trouble
for yourselves. If in Mazatlán you should meet the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Señorita</i>”&mdash;and he whispered her name reverently&mdash;“please
to tell her that I would have come. Good-by,
my friends.”</p>

<p>He glanced toward the car window, where the
other American stared with blanched face. And he
laughed. Then, with characteristic vanity, he
stroked back the hair from his forehead.</p>

<p>“If any one shoots,” he said, “please not to shoot
at the face.”</p>

<p>The horseman dug his spurs into the beast, and
the rope tightened. The tree was not high enough.
The little General reached earthward with his toes,
barely touching the ground with them, balancing
there in an instinctive effort to preserve life, even
for a moment. The officer gave an order. The men
unslung their rifles, and fired a scattering volley.</p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p>As the smoke cleared away, the train crawled
slowly onward toward Mazatlán. For a long time,
no one spoke. When Eustace finally broke the
silence, it was in a futile effort to turn our minds to
another subject.</p>

<p>“We’ll get there just in time to catch the boat
south.”</p>

<p>The soap-salesman came out of his reverie with
a start.</p>

<p>“I don’t know as I’ll go south. I think I’ll catch
a boat north to Frisco. You can’t do business with
these spi&mdash;with these Mexicans.”</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>It was evening when the train brought Eustace
and myself into Mazatlán. Since the fortnightly
steamer was scheduled to sail for the
south at eight o’clock, we leaped into a cab, and
ordered the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cochero</i> to drive like fury.</p>

<p>He whipped up his slumbering nags, and we rattled
toward the wharf, through conventional narrow
streets lined with the traditional fortress-like houses
of Latin America. But&mdash;although it may have been
the effect of the tropical climate&mdash;it seemed that
each balcony or window was occupied by a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señorita</i>
infinitely more attractive than any that had occupied
the same sort of balcony or window in the same
sort of dwellings in any of the previous cities.</p>

<p>“Whoa!” called Eustace. “In the interests
of journalism, let’s have a longer look at this
town!”</p>

<p>But before the interests of journalism were fully
satisfied, the steamer whistled from the harbor, and
our <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cochero</i> whipped up his horses again. On we
rattled until we came to the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>. It was an unusually
attractive <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>. There were royal poincianas,
tinkling fountains, and&mdash;</p>

<p>“Whoa!” called Eustace. “In the int&mdash;”</p>

<p>The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i> also appeared to be inhabited by what
evidently was the most abundant product of Mazatlán.
But the steamer whistled again, and the whip
crackled, and we careened wildly around sharp
corners to the harbor. It was a delightful harbor.
A semi-circle of driveway bordered it&mdash;a driveway
lined with graceful cocoa-palms that whispered
softly in the gentle breeze. A newly risen moon
peeped through their fronds, and sparkled along the
wide expanse of sea, tipping each wave with a streak
of silver as the swells rolled in from the Pacific to
shatter themselves in gleaming spray against the
rocks before us. From the thatched cottages of the
fisher-folk across the bay there drifted to us the
tinkle of a guitar. And from the city behind us
sounded the chimes of a cathedral clock. It was
striking eight&mdash;the hour our steamer was to sail.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” we shouted. “We’ve missed it!”</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>We had just acquired the mental attitude requisite
to appreciation of Mexico&mdash;a state of unworried
and unhurried tranquillity such as enables the Mexican
himself to sit all day on a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i> bench, enjoying
the balmy southern breezes, smoking innumerable
cigarettes, discussing nothing in particular,
watching the other idlers, and admiring the beauties&mdash;both
animate and inanimate&mdash;of the whole pleasant
scene.</p>

<p>Mazatlán had been designed for people with such
a mental attitude. The climate was balmy. The
whole city was quaintly Mexican. There was not a
tourist sight in town. There was, in short, nothing
to do except to sit in the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>&mdash;such a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i> as
might be found in any other Mexican city, a little
square park with a music kiosk in the center, surrounded
by palms and ferns and shaded walks, and
with an aged white cathedral for its background.
Sitting there, one saw the entire population pass in
review, for as elsewhere in Mexico, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i> was
at once a club, a meeting place, a music-hall, a playground,
and even a marriage market.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>On my first morning, fortunately a Sunday morning,
while I still retained a slight vestige of Anglo-Saxon
energy, I was there at daybreak, determined
to observe minutely what transpired.</p>

<p>At 6.30, the only other occupants of the benches
were several ragged beggars.</p>

<p>At 7.00, the Mazatlán Street Cleaning Department,
both members barefoot, appeared upon the
scene, dragging a long hose, whereupon the beggars
cautiously adjourned to the steps of the municipal
building.</p>

<p>At 7.29, the first bootblack stopped to point accusingly
at my shoes. No sooner had he polished
them than a dozen other bootblacks stopped to point
at them, evidently presuming that shoe-polish acted
like alcohol, and that I would now suffer from an insatiable
craving for more.</p>

<p>At 7.30, I discovered that wiggling a finger&mdash;the
Latin-American gesture for “No!”&mdash;required less
energy than shaking the head.</p>

<p>At 7.47, the first excitement! A policeman’s
whistle screamed an alarm! The policeman was
chasing a small and very ragged urchin diagonally
across the park. The urchin appeared to be gaining,
but just as they reached the corner, out popped
another policeman, also tooting his whistle, and
both pursued the youth up the north side of the
square, until joined by a third officer, similarly
shrilling the alarm. They disappeared around the
cathedral, and the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i> idlers settled back into their
seats. Popular sentiment seemed to be with the
urchin.</p>

<p>At 7.48, a party of dogs invaded the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i> fountain
to enjoy a bath.</p>

<p>At 7.49, a party of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peons</i> drove the dogs out of the
fountain to enjoy a drink.</p>

<p>At 7.50, the ragged urchin reappeared, having
doubled around the cathedral. There were now six
cops in pursuit, still tooting their whistles. Pursued
and pursuers ran diagonally back across the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>. At the southeast corner, a seventh policeman
dived out from behind a rubbish can, and effected
the capture. All marched away with a dignity that
emphasized the majesty of the law. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>
idlers settled back again. No one inquired the
wherefore of the chase. All seemed sufficiently
pleased that there had been such diversion.</p>

<p>At 8.00, the cathedral bells rang, not solemnly as
though in invitation to mass, but rapidly and aggressively,
commanding attendance.</p>

<p>At 8.01, two middle-aged male <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peons</i> entered the
church. They wore their shirts outside the pants,
in Indian fashion, and were unconcernedly holding
hands, like a pair of children.</p>

<p>At 8.35, more excitement! Policemen’s whistles
were tooting again. This time a pig had invaded
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>. Evidently pigs were not allowed there
except when muzzled and on leash. Six policemen,
assisted by a full corps of bootblacks, chased the
snorting little porker around palm trees and through
the flower beds.</p>

<p>At 8.37, the policemen formed an escort, and
marched away again, still with dignity and majesty,
escorting the latest captive to the police barracks.</p>

<p>At 9.00, the cathedral bell resumed its unhallowed
racket.</p>

<p>At 9.08, Carmen Rosa María de la Concepción
Purísima Rodríguez, who lived upstairs opposite the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>, commenced her piano lesson, playing those
rippling little Spanish melodies, with occasional
pauses while she searched for the bass note.</p>

<p>At 9.09, I decided to stroll to the other side of
the park.</p>

<p>At 9.10, I found Eustace sitting on a bench with
a distinguished-looking middle-aged American who,
I hoped, would gratify my ideas of romance by proving
an absconded bank cashier. But he was introduced
as a mining man by the name of Werner. He
was eating oranges and tossing the peels into the
shrubbery, meanwhile bowing to the celebrities who
passed. “Here comes General <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Cómo-se-Llama</i>, the
worst cut-throat in Mexico. Hello, General, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">muy
buenas días</i>, how are you?”</p>

<p>At 9.11, a second general passed, in a uniform
which he had designed himself&mdash;sky blue cap, bright
red coat, and green trousers, all embellished with
gold braid. He was five feet high, and four feet
wide. “They use him for dress parade,” said Werner.</p>

<p>At 9.12, a third general passed, marching through
the street, followed by eight soldiers.</p>

<p>At 9.49, the first pretty <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señoritas</i>, on their way to
mass with a forbidding-looking mother, stopped to
rest on the bench opposite. The girls wore the latest
Parisian modes, but mother still clung to the
old-fashioned <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">rebozo</i>, or shawl. Each wore a little
black lace <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mantilla</i> pinned to the hair. One girl
noted that we were looking at her, and her eyes
twinkled appreciatively. She whispered to the
other girl, and both smiled.</p>

<p>At 9.51, after an accusing glance from mother, we
decided to stroll around the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>. “They’ll consider
it an insult,” said Werner. “They expect you
to stay here and talk together about how lovely they
are, just loud enough for them to hear it.”</p>

<p>At 10.26, the musicians gathered for their Sunday
morning concert. Having tuned up, they continued
to blow and toot, indulging the Mexicans’ love of
noise. Half of them were unshod; all were brown;
none looked like accomplished artists. I dreaded
the racket they’d make when all tooted at once.</p>

<p>At 10.30, they played the most beautiful band
music I had ever heard.</p>

<p>At 10.52, society emerged from the cathedral.
Barefoot <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peons</i> withdrew from the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i> to make
room for the aristocrats.</p>

<p>At 11.00, the beggars became active. The blind
men closed their eyes, and the cripples started to
flop. They wriggled from bench to bench; they
suffered themselves to be led by little children; they
crawled in snake-like twists and propelled themselves
in frog-like jumps; they hobbled upon
crutches; they stumped upon legless knees; they
turned over on their backs and squirmed upside
down. At each bench, they would whine in plaintive
voice, “A little penny, for the sake of God, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señores</i>!”
The Mexicans liked this. They regarded
beggars as an institution that enabled them to gratify
personal vanity by giving alms. It did not cost
much. And they regarded curse or blessing with
superstitious respect. So the procession hopped
and flopped and squirmed and for-god-saked unmolested
all around the park.</p>

<p>At 11.10, the Promenade was in full swing. The
elders kept a watchful eye on their daughters from
the benches. The youths draped themselves gracefully
on their canes along the outer walk. The girls,
in merry groups of twos and threes and fours, arm
in arm, swung past on exhibition&mdash;dainty little creatures,
fairly radiating sweetness and modesty, yet
keenly aware of the masculine admiration they
aroused, quick to notice if a youth’s gaze lingered,
ready to exchange opinions in whispered conference,
ready even to respond with a brief flash of eyes,
supremely self-assured, yet never bold. From childhood
they had paraded this <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>, accustoming
themselves to the sensation of being on exhibition.
They liked to be looked at. It brought a flush to
their cheeks, and a luster to their dark eyes. This
was their only opportunity, in an existence of semi-seclusion,
to see and to be seen. There were stolid-looking
maids in the procession, carrying babies all
done up in silks and laces. There were little girls of
ten and twelve, already practicing coquetry. And
there were innumerable maidens of fifteen and
twenty, suitable for marriage, and watching the
circle of young men for an indication that to-day’s
parade had awakened the divine fire.</p>

<p>At 11.20, the first youth fell. He detached himself
from the onlookers and&mdash;accompanied by a companion
who carefully showed his neutrality by a
super-nonchalance of manner&mdash;followed one of the
damsels around and around the square, affecting a
melting expression of countenance, and beseeching
her with melancholy eyes for a backward glance.
The girl’s companions nudged her and giggled; the
girl herself pretended to be unaware that she was
followed; but the flush heightened in her cheeks, and
her eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>At 11.59, the families reassembled, and moved
homeward, each a parade by itself. The enamored
youth gazed in the proper affectation of despair
after his departing maiden, and gave an imitation
of a candle that has been extinguished.</p>

<p>At 12.00, Werner announced that the bench-slats
had stamped him with an accordion-pleated design,
and left us.</p>

<p>At 12.01, two surviving <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señoritas</i>&mdash;the two of the
9.49 episode&mdash;stopped at our bench, and seated
themselves coyly at the far end.</p>

<p>At 12.02, a boy sold us three bags of peanuts for
a nickel.</p>

<p>At 12.04, not knowing what to do with the third
bag of peanuts, I offered it to the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señoritas</i>, and was
rewarded with a “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Gracias</i>” which could not have
been sweeter had the offering been a five-pound upholstered
box of the most expensive chocolates.</p>

<p>At 12.05, the observations inscribed in my now-faded
notebook during those first vestiges of Anglo-Saxon
energy, appear for some reason to have
ceased.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>As I recall that first conversation with Herminia
and Lolita, it ran somewhat as follows:</p>

<p>Were we from the United States? <em>Ay</em>, what a wonderful
country must be the United States! How
they would love to go to a land where women enjoyed
such freedom! And American men respected
women more than did the Mexicans. But how long
were we remaining in Mazatlán? So short a time!
Why did we not stay longer? Did we not think
Mexican girls as attractive as American girls? <em>Ay</em>,
but we were very polite to say such nice things!
Still, did we not have wives at home? Not even
sweethearts? No? Then why should one be in such
haste to leave Mazatlán? <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Ay, Dios!</i> The cathedral
clock was striking twelve and a half, and their family
would scold them for lingering so long! But they
came to the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i> every evening at eight. Yes, always
at eight. <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Adios!</i> And again <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">muchas gracias</i>
for the peanuts!</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i> became a very definite habit to Eustace
and myself. At home, we could never have loitered
day after day in a park, doing nothing, but
in Mexico one could. The other idlers were always
interesting. Some amusing little incident was
always happening. Yet nothing ever seemed to disturb
the prevailing restful calm.</p>

<p>Herminia and Lolita were always there at eight.</p>

<p>They were slender little girls, with the delicately
molded features and the immense dark eyes characteristic
of their race. They were adept, too, in
the use of those eyes&mdash;as all Spanish girls are adept&mdash;yet
if, to a casual observer they appeared flirtatious,
they proved upon further acquaintance&mdash;as all
Spanish girls prove&mdash;to be quite the most shy, and
modest, and altogether circumspect little misses to
be found anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>For some inexplicable reason, the Spanish <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señorita</i>
has been most inaccurately portrayed in our fiction
and drama as a wild vampire, modeled after the
operatic Carmen, until the average American pictures
her as a fiery adventuress who lifts one shoulder
higher than the other and curls her sensuous lips
into a sinister smile destined to wreck the life of
every passing bullfighter.</p>

<p class="center space-above"><span class="figcenter" id="i_010">
  <img src="images/010.jpg" class="w50"  alt="THE MEXICAN SEÑORITA HAS ALWAYS BEEN PORTRAYED IN
OUR FICTION AS A WILD VAMPIRE" />
</span></p>
<p class="center">THE MEXICAN SEÑORITA HAS ALWAYS BEEN PORTRAYED IN
OUR FICTION AS A WILD VAMPIRE<br /></p>

<p>In real life, the Mexican maiden&mdash;and one might
include her sisters of Spanish ancestry&mdash;is, with all
her mischievous smiling&mdash;the most timid, sedate and
well-behaved little miss that can be found anywhere.
She lives at home in semi-seclusion. She never appears
in public without a chaperon, except possibly
to stroll with another maiden to the shops or the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>. She is at all times guarded against the
machinations of wicked males&mdash;who are always assumed
to be predatory animals until they indicate
very definitely that they intend marriage, and who
are by no means to be trusted even then&mdash;and she
never meets a man except where others are present
or when the window-bars afford insulation for her
virtue.</p>

<p>In the more cosmopolitan centers, where the
daughters of the wealthier families have been educated
abroad, and where parents have adopted a
foreign viewpoint, this close guardianship is often
relaxed. But in the smaller city, like Mazatlán, the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señorita</i> is still the victim of a social system carefully
designed to protect her against a race of men
whose mind dwells almost exclusively on sex.</p>

<p>The Mexican&mdash;even more than most of his brothers
of Spanish ancestry&mdash;while he publicly extols
women as the most exquisite handiwork of God, privately
regards them as instruments exclusively for
the gratification of natural instincts. Although he
may talk eloquently of love, he is incapable of any
infatuation which is not based primarily upon sex
appeal. But, since he is a jealous creature, and since
he knows that his brothers, like himself, would take
advantage of any opportunity for seduction, he demands
that his wife be a model of unquestionable
propriety.</p>

<p>And the Mexican maiden, brought up to believe
that her only aim in life is to attract a husband,
smiles quite alluringly, and leads conversation to
sentimental themes, yet remains most circumspect.
In her smile there is a promise, but her family will
see that the promise is not fulfilled until marriage.</p>

<p>Even in love there is nothing genuinely impulsive
about the Latin of either sex. He, originally, is
motivated by the desire to possess something more
attractive and exclusive than the females which can
easily be found in Latin America, either in officially
segregated districts or among the servant classes.
She, originally, is motivated by a desire for home
and children&mdash;a desire not unknown among the
women of other countries, but far keener in lands
where, despite the inroads of foreign custom, there
is still but little amusement for women except the
care of babies.</p>

<p>Romance, in the beginning, is as carefully studied
by the Latin as is his politeness and his every other
quality. Once begun, since he is an adept at self-hypnotism,
it may become a thing of tremendous
emotion. Yet the courtship at all times follows an
extremely formal course. The youth, charmed by a
maiden’s smile (and having made inquiries about
her family), follows her home from the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i> night
after night, and leans against the opposite wall
to stare at her window until she, finally captivated
by his persistence (and having made inquiries about
his family), allows him to coo at her through the
bars. At length he makes a formal call, announces
his intentions, and is duly accepted by her parents,
who thereafter welcome him to the parlor, but seldom
allow him alone with the daughter.</p>

<p>It is the ideal system for these people. It may
seem absurd to a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Gringo</i>, yet it is quite satisfactory
to the Spanish-American. The barriers that surround
the girl prove to him that others have not been
able to reach her. If they prevent him from learning
her disposition, it does not particularly matter. He
knows that she has been brought up with the idea of
becoming an obedient wife. He does not expect intellectual
stimulation from her companionship. He
can see that she is beautiful and desirable. And if
there has been an element of premeditation in the beginning
of his courtship, his mental habit of dwelling
almost exclusively upon sex will soon arouse a
keen desire which the tantalizing window-bars merely
aggravate.</p>

<p>Yet after marriage, children usually bring something
akin to a higher love. The man may not remain
faithful, but he will provide for his wife, and
honor her, and accord her every respect. She, having
accomplished her chief aim in life, will forget
herself in her devotion to husband and offspring.
She will grow fat and sloppy, and spend most of her
time preparing daughters for <em>their</em> chief aim. But
at all times, unlike the Carmen of fiction, she will
be modest and reserved, and faithful to a degree
seldom found elsewhere in the world.</p>

<p>If Herminia and Lolita gave us a longer flash of
eyes than was customary, at eight o’clock in the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>, they were not adopting Carmen’s tactics.
They were merely two of many girls in a small city
which, like most small cities, was equipped with
comparatively few men to smile at.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>At that time, Eustace and I knew very little about
Spanish custom.</p>

<p>We looked upon our mild flirtation as a pleasant
and instructive way of spending the evening while
waiting for another boat.</p>

<p>Herminia and Lolita would pass us two or three
times, always with that promising flash of eyes, and
a murmured “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Adios</i>.” Presently they would stop
at a bench beyond, and glance back. Thereupon we
would rise, stroll around the park as we had seen
Mexican youths do, and stop casually, as though by
accident, at the girls’ bench.</p>

<p>And conversation, as I recall it, invariably ran
somewhat as follows:</p>

<p><em>Ay</em>, but one was surprised that to-night we came
to <em>their</em> bench! After the way we had stared at Carmen
Rosa María de la Concepción Purísima Rodríguez,
one expected that we might have gone to <em>her</em>
bench. <em>Ay</em>, but both of them had seen! And Carmen
Rosa María was the most beautiful girl in
Mazatlán, no? No? Then who was? Ay, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gracias,
gracias, señores</i>! So nice it was that we should say
so! Did we really think so? Ay, but we were <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">simpatico</i>&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">muy
simpatico</i>&mdash;to say it!</p>

<p>Then commenced the Spanish lesson. It seemed,
at times, a trifle impractical, for it was usually limited
to phrases conveying admiration of feminine
charm. If the male Latin-American revels in flattery,
the female lives upon it, and these two <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señoritas</i>
were merely typical of most of their sisters in
Mexico. A young man in their country was expected
to spend the entire evening raving about their
beauty. It mattered not how elaborate were his
phraseology; he could expand his theme to a degree
which would have brought any American flapper to
her feet with the disgusted exclamation of, “How do
you get that way? Do you think I’m a dumb-bell?”,
yet here it was not only accepted, but demanded.
This, as any traveling Gringo soon discovers in
Mexico, was the theme most interesting to a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señorita</i>.</p>

<p>I suspected, at times, that I lacked the true grace
of the Spanish cavalier. Since my command of the
language was still somewhat limited, it was necessary
to repeat the same phrases with tiresome regularity.
I became aware of a foreboding, as we sat
there beneath the coco-palms, that if I recited those
phrases once more, all the cocoanuts would drop on
me.</p>

<p>But when I suggested, as a change of entertainment,
that we stroll over to a little café on the harbor-front
for ice cream, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señoritas</i> were quite
shocked.</p>

<p><em>Ay</em>, but one was now in Mexico! It was not custom!
People would talk! And was it true that in
the United States the girls&mdash;nice girls&mdash;could do
such things? One had heard so, but it sounded incredible.
One had even heard that young people
went away, without chaperones, to theaters or
dances. And was this true? One had actually
heard that there were petting parties. How delightfully
wicked! <em>Ay</em>, what a wonderful place must be
the United States!</p>

<p>There was a pleasing simplicity about these little
convent-sheltered maidens. If they craved flattery
until it seemed a bit monotonous, one could at least
pay it with veracity. And the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>, although it
was overpopulated with observers, was always pleasant.
One had the illusion, particularly in the evening,
that it was a theater where one collaborated
with the rest of the populace in enacting a polite
comedy-drama. The palms and ferns hung lifeless
in the tropic calm, and the red hibiscus resembled
paper flowers. The old cathedral transformed itself
into a backdrop. The strains of the band came to
one as from an orchestra hidden off-stage. There
was something unreal about the soft whispers and
the rippling laughter of the other youths and maidens.
And when, as the chimes announced the hour
of ten, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señoritas</i> betook themselves homeward
with cheerful little calls of “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Adios</i> until to-morrow!”,
I waited expectantly for a curtain to descend.</p>

<p>One evening, after the girls had departed, Werner
stopped at our bench.</p>

<p>“Just thought I’d warn you,” he said. “I know
you don’t mean any harm. There’s something about
this place that makes one lonesome for feminine company.
But down here, unless you show very definitely
that you intend marriage, they take it for
granted you’re up to monkey business. So just go
easy, or you’ll have their family jumping on your
necks.”</p>

<p>We thanked him. It was timely advice. And
when, on the following evening, the girls suggested
that we meet the family, we agreed. It seemed
advisable as an indication of the highly sanitary
state of our consciences.</p>

<p>Theirs was the usual one-story dwelling of solid
masonry characteristic of the country. A faded and
crumbling plaster front concealed a pleasing, albeit
conventional interior. The living room was floored
with cool tiling. The furnishings&mdash;except for a
piano with yellowed keys, and a marble-topped table
littered with forbidding pictures of stout female
ancestors&mdash;consisted mainly of stiff-backed chairs
formally arranged in a row along each wall; yet
the conventional effect was relieved somewhat by
numerous white lace doilies on the seats, or by
potted palms which gave the room the semblance
of a garden.</p>

<p>The family proved gracious, but not entertaining.
Papa and mama assured us that the house was ours&mdash;as
is customary when a stranger enters the Latin-American
home. Then, one by one, they brought forward
their relatives and presented them&mdash;a daughter
or two, several sons, a few cousins, nephews or
nieces, a flock of aunts, some assorted uncles or
brothers-in-law with their respective families, and
finally grandma. Having informed us in turn that
they were our servants, they took seats until the
walls were lined with them, and silence fell upon
the gathering.</p>

<p>Papa opened the conversation with a pleasant inquiry
regarding the object of our visit to Mazatlán.
Ah, we were writers! An admiring nod ran around
the circle, finally reaching grandma, where it
stopped momentarily until Uncle Somebody transmitted
our answer through an ear trumpet. Grandma
seemed a trifle perplexed, as though she did not
know just what writers might be, but she nodded
politely. Thus the conversation proceeded, papa
acting as spokesman for the entire party, until&mdash;after
the ordeal had continued for an hour or more&mdash;a
servant entered with glasses of vermouth, and our
reception closed in a toast proposed by papa to the
“very distinguished guests, who have honored our
humble household to-night.”</p>

<p>Our necks seemed to be free from the likelihood of
assault, for upon the following evening the girls announced
that they had permission to stroll beyond
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>, as far as the driveway that bordered the
harbor.</p>

<p>“Never have our parents permitted it with our
own countrymen,” they added. “Our people trust
Americans more than themselves.”</p>

<p>To show our appreciation, we took the girls home
each night, even though it involved another session
at which the family lined up around the wall to nod
while papa conducted another tedious conversation.
Yet, if we were occasionally bored, our two weeks
passed rapidly.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Our steamer finally whistled from the harbor. We
had already purchased our tickets, and were on our
way to bid the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señoritas</i> farewell, when Werner intercepted
us, waving a newspaper.</p>

<p>“Congratulations, boys! You’ve picked out
mighty nice girls!”</p>

<p>Papa, it seems, had announced our engagement
without consulting us. It was in the daily journal of
Mazatlán!</p>

<p>“Why, good Heavens! Look here, Werner, we
haven’t said a word to them! We called at the house
every night, and we walked along the Olas Altas,
with the permission of the family, but&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, you called at the house every night! That’s
the worst thing you could have done, my boys!
That’s considered an avowal down here&mdash;especially
since the town’s full of marriageable daughters with
scarcely any men in sight! And it’s taken for
granted, of course, that all Americans are millionaires.
So you’re engaged all right. Now, what are
you going to do about it?”</p>

<p>“I can’t think of any suggestion,” said Eustace,
“except that we run like the devil for that boat.”</p>

<p>Werner shook his head.</p>

<p>“That means the girls are ruined for life. When
a man breaks the engagement, it’s assumed that he’s
learned the girl wasn’t chaste, or that he’s succeeded
himself and doesn’t want her any more. No one else
would marry them after that. And it’s hell to be an
old maid in Mexico.”</p>

<p>We were somewhat appalled. They were really
very lovely little girls. But a Gringo couldn’t pay
compliments night after night for the next fifty
years. And one thought, too, of grandma and her
ear trumpet, and a solemn circle of relatives, and a
table littered with pictures of forbidding-visaged
female ancestors.</p>

<p>“There’s one way out,” said Werner. “Say good-by
to them as though you were going on a short
business trip. From Manzanillo wire me that you
were shot by bandits. That’ll clear the girls. Hurry
now, or you’ll miss another boat. And by the way,
when you wire me that you’re dead, don’t sign your
own names.”</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>At 7.49 p.m., having recovered the last vestiges
of my Anglo-Saxon energy, I drove with Eustace
to the house, and bade the family farewell. The girls
appeared a trifle distressed, but not so much as we
felt they ought to be. The family knew intuitively
that we were fleeing, but with true Mexican politeness
they accepted our explanations as though they
believed.</p>

<p>At 7.52, we leaped back into the cab and ordered
the cochero to drive like fury.</p>

<p>At 7.56, we passed the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>, but paused not in the
interests of journalism.</p>

<p>At 8.00, we sailed out of Mazatlán’s attractive
harbor, where the moonlight sparkled along the wide
expanse of sea, and the tinkle of a guitar came to us
from the thatched cottages of the fisher-folk, as
though it were an accompaniment to the chimes of
the old cathedral clock that we knew so well. Eight
o’clock! Herminia and Lolita would be strolling in
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>, where the strains of the band, as though
from an orchestra off-stage, blended with the ripple
of the fountain, with the voices of youths and maidens
and the whispering of the palm trees!</p>

<p>At 8.01, Eustace discovered three peanuts in his
pocket, and we solemnly dumped them overboard.</p>

<small>IN THE DAYS OF CARRANZA</small></h2></div>




<h3>I</h3>

<p>The steamer plowed southward through a dazzling
blue sea to Manzanillo, the port of disembarkation
for Mexico City.</p>

<p>Despite its commercial importance, this is one
of the several places on the Pacific Coast where a
traveler, upon leaving his ship, takes one hasty
glance at the dirty black beach and the cluster of
driftwood shacks, grasps his nose firmly between
thumb and forefinger, and makes a dash for the daily
train that will carry him somewhere else.</p>

<p>As soon as a boatman had rowed us ashore,
Eustace and I hastened to the telegraph office, and
dispatched our message to Werner: “Foster and
Eustace slain by bandits.” Then we ran for the
train. But, although an excited crowd surrounded
the station, there was no train in sight.</p>

<p>“There will be none to-day,” explained the agent.
“Zamorra stopped it just outside of town, wrecked
it, and shot most of the passengers.”</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>By sheer coincidence, our message to Werner had
been seemingly confirmed. Following the news
dispatch of this hold-up, which undoubtedly would
reach Mazatlán, the notice of our murder would
carry conviction. For the moment, we were delighted.
Then the agent added:</p>

<p>“There may be no train for several weeks.”</p>

<p>And we found ourselves stranded in the filthiest
hole in Mexico. Manzanillo’s streets were of thick
sand, inadequately paved in spots with refuse or
garbage, over which hovered millions of flies, and
about which a host of black buzzards were picking
and quarreling. The whole town was perched upon
a narrow landspit between the murky bay and a still
murkier lagoon, and backed by low hills whose scraggly
jungle-growth the tropic sun had burned to a
crisp. A few buildings of wood or plaster rose to
the majesty of a second story; the others were low
and of ramshackle structure, their driftwood composition
varied occasionally by patches of flattened tin
that had once done service as Standard Oil cans.
The roofs were mainly of thatch. Interior decoration,
as glimpsed through doorless doorways, was
limited to pages from the local equivalents of the
<i>Police Gazette</i>. Over the whole unsightly place there
hung an odor of rotted fish, emanating from neighboring
lagoons which had evaporated throughout
the long dry season to nothing more than a crust
of reddish scum.</p>

<p>The principal virtue of the leading hotel&mdash;a
wobbly two-story edifice operated by a Chinaman&mdash;was
that it possessed enough odors of its own to neutralize
the fishy breezes from the lagoon. The food
was nauseous and the water poisonous. The natives
of the town quenched their thirst at the stagnant
jungle pools by rolling up a leaf into the semblance
of a funnel, poking it through the inch of scum that
covered the water, and drinking the fluid beneath
with ecstatic sucks. Cautious foreigners were
forced to patronize the hotel bar, where the beer
ascended in temperature from lukewarm in the
morning to some degree near boiling point in mid-afternoon.</p>

<p>Determined to make the best of our indefinite residence,
we looked about for amusement.</p>

<p>There was always the beach. Its sand was black,
and the rollers assumed the shade of molasses. The
women of the town, since Mexican women are too
modest to wear short-skirted bathing suits, always
took their bath in a clumsy white linen gown which
reached to the ankles, but which, as soon as it was
wet, became completely diaphanous. They were as
dark, usually, as the beach, and the silhouette effect
was highly educational.</p>

<p>When the sights of the waterfront had received
due attention, we retired to the lagoons to hunt alligators.
In the larger pools, which had not completely
evaporated, we could see the corrugated tails
of the big caymans tracing a leisurely path across
the surface, and occasionally by making our way
silently along the brush-grown shore, we could surprise
a greenish-gray monster asleep on the mud-flats.
Our diminutive pistols seemed to have little
effect on their tough hide; our shots brought only a
splash as the quarry plunged into the lagoon; a few
bubbles would rise, and a muddy discoloration of the
water would indicate that the alligator was safely
imbedded in the loamy bottom of the pool. We tried
to lasso one of them, with a loop of rope on the end
of a pole, but the monster vanished, as usual, carrying
with him the stoutest cord to be purchased in
Manzanillo.</p>

<p>From alligator-hunting we turned to a study of
natural history in general. The town and its environs
offered plenty of material. One could scarcely
walk the streets without shooing buzzards out of the
way. Sooty black in color, with ashen-gray neck
curved to suggest hunched shoulders, they hopped
about with rocketing step, pouncing with hoggish
squeals upon rotted carrion, and squabbling among
themselves over its possession. One was tempted
always to try the pistols on <em>them</em>, but they were
protected by law, for without their services in disposing
of the mess which Latin-American servants
are accustomed to toss from the kitchen window,
cities like Manzanillo would be altogether uninhabitable.</p>

<p>Of insects there was an infinite variety. We did
not have to seek them; they sought us. One could
not push through the jungle without being bitten by
ants on the bushes. In the town itself, half the
population seemed to find constant occupation in
picking something out of the other half’s hair. The
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peon</i> women would form a small circle, back to back,
and perform this friendly little operation with one-hundred-per
cent. efficiency. In the hotel room the
scratchy noise of cockroaches scrambling up and
down the wall lulled us to sleep each night.</p>

<p>Eustace, not content with this material for study,
took up snakes in a serious fashion. He had once
earned his way through college by feeding the reptiles
in a neighboring zoo, and had formed a strange
affection for them. He maintained that they recognized
him as a friend and refused to bite. In Manzanillo
he discovered a family of young serpents&mdash;squirmy
green fellows which we could not identify
but which the natives regarded as extremely venomous&mdash;whereupon
he brought a handful of them to
our room, and dumped his other possessions out of
his suit-case to make a home for them. Later, when
I absent-mindedly opened the same suit-case in
search of cigars, and fled precipitately, our Chinese
proprietor was greatly incensed because for days
afterward the snakes would appear at the most unexpected
moments in various parts of the establishment,
to the terror of servants and guests.</p>

<p>It not only worried his regular boarders, he said,
but ruined trade at the bar. After a drink of hot
beer, when a patron saw these things writhing across
the counter&mdash;well, just yesterday the mayor himself
had overturned a whole tray of glasses, smashed
two chairs in his haste to reach the open air, and had
not returned since! And the mayor was one of his
best customers!</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>The bandit attack upon the train had occurred so
close to the city that the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Carranzista</i> garrison threw
up temporary barricades on the approaches to town.</p>

<p>Instead of sallying forth to pursue the bandits,
however, the soldiers contented themselves with a
daily parade across the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>, led by a wheezy band
of four pieces, intended presumably to reassure the
civilian population.</p>

<p>The local <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">commandante</i> had suddenly assumed an
air of great importance. He was a tall man with
broad but extremely thin shoulders, with a wasp-like
waist, and with legs that tapered toward the ground
until one marveled that he could maintain his equilibrium
in a stiff breeze. As though to accentuate the
top-heavy effect, he wore the largest-brimmed <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">sombrero</i>
in Mexico, a pair of moustachios that curled in
several spiral twists, a flowing red necktie, six kilometers
of cartridge belt, and a massive old rifle,
while he clad his slender ankles in skin-tight
Spanish trousers of a type seldom seen to-day except
upon the stage.</p>

<p>Seeing him alone, one felt that the rank of general
was too little for him. Seeing him with his twenty
valiant soldiers, one felt that the grade of corporal
was too much.</p>

<p>The first qualification for a federal soldier in
Mexico appears to be that he shall not exceed four
feet in height. He comes invariably from the very
lowest rank of society, which in Mexico is extremely
low. He represents the poorest&mdash;and frequently the
worst&mdash;specimen of humanity in the republic. In the
days of Carranza he was ununiformed, except in the
capital, and usually barefoot. He was generally
dirty and unshaven, and his principal occupation
seemed to be that of lounging on street-corners, insulting
passing servant maids.</p>

<p>No motive of patriotism had prompted his enlistment.
In some cases he was a mere boy attracted
by the privilege of carrying a rifle. In others, he
was a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peon</i> drafted against his will. In others, he
was some old devil who could earn a living in no
other fashion. Having been issued his arms, he became
a full-fledged soldier. No one drilled him. He
was allowed to wear whatever clothes he already
possessed, although a faded pair of overalls was
considered especially <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de rigeur</i>. Sometimes he received
a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peso</i> a day, sometimes nothing. When I
was in Mazatlán, a federal paymaster newly arrived
with a satchelful of gold for the local garrison was
giving such an elaborate series of booze-parties to
his friends, that one wondered how much the troops
did receive.</p>

<p>Such discipline as the soldiers possessed was due
solely to fear of their particular commander.
Under a <em>strong</em> man they made pretty fair soldiers.
Under a <em>weak</em> man they were quite apt temporarily
to turn bandits themselves. Every train in Mexico
in those days was accompanied by a guard of them,
but they seldom offered resistance in case of a
hold-up.</p>

<p class="center space-above"><span class="figcenter" id="i_011">
  <img src="images/011.jpg" class="w50"  alt="IN THE DAYS OF CARRANZA ONE FREQUENTLY SAW A BANDIT
HANGING AROUND THE RAILWAY" />
</span></p>
<p class="center">IN THE DAYS OF CARRANZA ONE FREQUENTLY SAW A BANDIT
HANGING AROUND THE RAILWAY<br /></p>

<p>“Why should they?” said an Old-Timer in Manzanillo.
“The bandits don’t attack unless they outnumber
the guard. The soldiers haven’t much
chance. If the bandits win, they make a lot of money.
If the soldiers win, they get nothing. So they usually
cut and run.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s what they did when Zamorra
held up this train?”</p>

<p>“No. According to reports, they pitched in and
helped Zamorra rob the passengers.”</p>

<p>Even though our <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Commandante</i> marched across
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i> each day behind his wheezy band, Manzanillo
was expecting an attack, and there was considerable
speculation as to what part the garrison
would play. But the gunboat <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Guererro</i>&mdash;one half
of the Mexican navy&mdash;finally came down the coast
from Guaymas, and landed a force of sailors. Under
their escort a party of workmen marched out to the
scene of the disaster, and we followed them.</p>

<p>It was a jolly little picture. Pedro Zamorra, the
local <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">bandido</i>, had twisted the rails and removed a
few ties at a point where the train came around a
bend. All that remained of the cars was a mess of
twisted iron and a pile of splintered boards. A
thousand ashen-gray buzzards were picking and
quarreling about the wreckage. A thousand more,
sleek and content, roosted upon the surrounding hillsides.
From the tangled débris the workmen extracted
the few remaining bodies of the passengers&mdash;very
nonchalantly and unconcernedly, as though
this were an accustomed task&mdash;and heaped them into
a gruesome pyramid. A few cans of oil&mdash;a match&mdash;a
bonfire. The buzzards glared in silent indignation
at this interruption of their holiday. And the workmen
commenced the labor of reconstruction.</p>

AROUND A BEND<br /></p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>This was a common enough spectacle in those days
to the residents of Mexico.</p>

<p>For years the republic had been in the throes of
civil war&mdash;ever since the downfall of the great Dictator,
Porfirio Diaz.</p>

<p>Diaz had built up his country by encouraging the
foreign capitalist and the foreign promoter. It had
become one of the leading nations of the world. But
Mexican pride had been wounded at the admission
that foreigners were essential to Mexico’s development
and prosperity. Mexican jealousy had resented
the fortunes which the foreigners were reaping.
Mexico had risen to cast out Diaz, and no other
man had proved capable of filling his place. Conditions
had grown steadily worse, until a dozen revolutionary
leaders were squabbling for the presidency,
each of them ruling a portion of the republic and
claiming to rule the whole.</p>

<p>In an effort to bring order out of chaos the American
government&mdash;under Wilson and Bryan&mdash;had
recognized Venustiano Carranza as “First Chief.”
With American arms and ammunition, which proved
even more useful than the American moral support,
Carranza took Mexico City and elected himself president.
In the estimation of most Old-Timers in the
country, the American government might much better
have recognized Pancho Villa or any other bandit.
For Carranza, of all the contenders for power,
was the leading exponent of the doctrine, “Mexico
for the Mexicans!” His first move was to promulgate
a new constitution, in many ways a splendid
document, but one that gave every right to the workman
and none to the capitalist. The foreigner
promptly withdrew. And Mexico, in the hands of
the Mexicans, enjoyed a complete economic collapse.</p>

<p>Without employment, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peon</i> everywhere turned
to banditry as the only profitable occupation. Rebel
leaders continued to dominate many sections of the
republic&mdash;Villa in Chihuahua, Pelaez in the Oil
Fields, Felix Diaz in Vera Cruz, Meixuerio in
Oaxaca, and others elsewhere. And even in the territory
nominally under Carranza control, gentlemen
like Pedro Zamorra were popping up from time to
time to spread a few rails, remove a few ties, pitch a
railway train over a cliff, and provide another holiday
for the buzzards.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Each evening in Manzanillo, when the beer had
lost its mid-day warmth, two or three Old-Timers,
stranded like ourselves, would gather at the bar to
discuss conditions.</p>

<p>The Old-Timer in Mexico is very much of a
type.</p>

<p>He is usually a quiet, unassuming man, with
grizzly gray hair, and friendly blue eyes. He came
from somewhere in the West or Middle West, so long
ago that he has forgotten just when. He owns a
mine that has ceased operation pending the arrival
of better times. He is easy-going and fatalistic, a
trifle careless about dress, blunt in manner yet with
a natural kindliness, slow of movement from long
residence in the tropics, and very fond of talking
about “these people,” by which he means the Mexicans.
During the last revolution they took all his
money away from him, and smashed up his mine, but
he still cherishes an affection for them. He is waiting
hopefully for another Diaz to bring prosperity
back to Mexico.</p>

<p>He is a trifle reticent at first about talking. He is
surprised that the itinerant writer regards him as
an interesting character. But he is secretly very
much pleased. Gradually he commences a yarn. It
suggests another, and that one suggests another,
until they follow in rapid succession.</p>

<p>Quoth one:</p>

<p>“I always used to carry a gun. Nowadays I’m
afraid to. It’s getting too dangerous. You can’t
tell who’s a bandit. Some one comes riding up to
you, looking like any other <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peon</i>, and just as he
reaches you, his blanket slides off his shoulder and
you’re looking into the muzzle of a six-shooter. Like
as not, too, he’s got some pal covering you from the
brush. If you’re armed, they’re likely to make it a
sure thing by shooting you first and robbing you
afterward. So, when I hit the interior nowadays, I
just take a bottle of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tequila</i>. When I meet a bandit,
I show him I haven’t anything worth taking, and
offer him a drink, and that ends it.”</p>

<p>Quoth another, a mining man from Durango:</p>

<p>“You see, there’s good bandits and bad bandits.
Lots of ’em are chaps as can’t make a living no other
way. And some’s just kids that think it’s smart,
and do it because it’s so easy. Take Trinidad, down
below Rosario. Just a youngster, but he’s got the
police buffaloed. Rides into town in broad daylight
and covers the barber with a Colt while he gets
shaved. Shoots up a dance-hall now and then, but
don’t do much real harm.</p>

<p>“Only trouble with Trini is that he likes women.
He come down from the hills one day with five of
his gang, going to Rosario for something or other,
and on the way he seen a fifteen-year-old girl&mdash;daughter
of some rancher. Says he to the father,
‘I’ll stop to-morrow and take her along home with
me.’ Well, the father wasn’t thrilled at having Trini
for a son-in-law, especially so informal-like, so he
sent to town for protection, and got a couple of
dozen soldiers. They was all asleep in the shade
next afternoon, when Trini gallops up, swings the
girl on his saddle&mdash;most of these country kids think
it’s kind of romantic to be taken away like that&mdash;and
off he goes with her. The soldiers chased him, of
course, but he held them off in a mountain pass ’til
dark, and got away with her.</p>

<p>“That’s the way things are these days. I’m still
trying to run my mine up in Durango, and I’m paying
taxes to Carranza for protection, but I have to
pay four different bandits to leave me alone. Even
then, I got to ship my ore unsmelted for a hundred
miles. If I sent out pure bullion, some other bandit
would probably grab it.”</p>

<p>Quoth a third:</p>

<p>“There’s worse than Trini just north of here, up in
Tepic. They were capturing people so often that a
prominent banker up in Mazatlán was making a
regular business of ransoming them. He went down
one time with five thousand pesos to buy another
fellow’s liberty, and the bandits grabbed him, and
held him until his friends sent down five thousand
pesos more. So anybody who gets caught now is out
of luck. Those fellows have a nasty habit of cutting
off your finger each week, and sending it up, all nicely
preserved in a bottle of alcohol so it can be recognized,
with a little reminder that unless the cash
comes pretty soon, they’ll send the head.”</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>So worthless were the federal troops that many
Americans whom I met during my trip professed a
preference for bandits.</p>

<p>One, operating a mine in Hidalgo in a town that
had never contained a Carranza garrison, had experienced
no difficulty at all. Twice he had been visited
by members of Pelaez’s gang, and on both occasions
the rebels had paid for whatever they took
from the company’s stores. When the governor of
Hidalgo announced that he was sending troops to
guard the mine&mdash;for which courtesy the mining company
was supposed to pay&mdash;the American protested
that he needed no troops. The soldiers were sent,
despite the protest. On the night of their arrival,
the company stores were looted by “bandits.”</p>

<p>While I was in Manzanillo, thieves raided the
ranch of Tom Johnson, an American living a few
miles south of the port. Among other plunder, they
took away five mules. A few days later a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Carranzista</i>
lieutenant rode up to the ranch-house with the
animals, announcing that he had recaptured them,
and demanding a reward.</p>

<p>“Reward!” exclaimed Johnson. “Why, you’re
being paid by your government to recapture stolen
property. I won’t pay you a damned <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">centavo</i>!”</p>

<p>The lieutenant laughed.</p>

<p>“Very well, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>.”</p>

<p>And he rode away, taking the mules with him.</p>

<p>In recognizing Carranza, our State Department
had merely created trouble for Americans living in
the territory controlled by other leaders.</p>

<p>Several weeks later, in Vera Cruz, I was to meet
Dr. Charles T. Sturgis and his wife, who had been
held prisoners for many months by <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Zapatistas</i> in
Chiapas. Dr. Sturgis, a retired dentist, had lived a
quiet life for years upon his farm in Southern
Mexico, practicing his profession gratis among the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peons</i> of his neighborhood. One day a party of
rebels kidnapped him and his wife, and brought him
to the bandit camp on the Rio de la Venta, where
they set the Doctor to work on the bandits’ teeth,
while Mrs. Sturgis was assigned to labor with the
native women. Mrs. Sturgis’ mother, who also had
been kidnapped, died after a few weeks. Neither the
Doctor nor his wife were young, or robust, yet Cal y
Mayor, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Zapatista</i> chieftain, constantly added insult
and injury to their toil and privation.</p>

<p>“Why do you go out of your way to hurt us?”
Mrs. Sturgis asked him.</p>

<p>“Because your Gringo president has recognized
my enemy!” he answered.</p>

<p>For months they remained prisoners. The chieftain
used Mrs. Sturgis as a messenger to other bandits,
on missions which he considered unsafe for his
own men, always holding her husband as hostage for
her return. At last, when illness had rendered the
Doctor unfit for further work, they were released,
with one horse for the two of them, and with only
five <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tortillas</i> as food for their journey of sixty miles
through a tropical jungle. When, after six days,
they reached their farm, they found that the Carranza
government had declared them rebel sympathizers
and had confiscated their property. Strange
natives were gathering the crops they had sowed.
Friends provided funds for their journey to Vera
Cruz, where they were to embark for New Orleans.
When I met the frail, gray-haired couple in the
Vera Cruz consulate, they were on the verge of nervous
breakdown.</p>

<p>Yet compared with some Americans, they were
fortunate. Many of the stories one picked up at that
time were unprintable, particularly those of young
girls who fell into bandit hands.</p>

<p>“We went up to Washington,” said one Old-Timer,
“with actual photographs of two American
women after the rebels were through with them.
And those fellows in the State Department just
raised both hands and shook their heads, and told us:
‘But such things can’t possibly be true!’”</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Everywhere in those days <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Carranzista</i> generals
could be seen disporting themselves in the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>.</p>

<p>“If they’d get busy, couldn’t they clean up the
bandits?” I asked an Old-Timer in Manzanillo.</p>

<p>“Quite likely. But that’s hard work. And they
don’t really want to. If they licked all the bandits,
the need for so many generals would cease. A general
has a pretty good job, you know. Even though
he doesn’t get so much salary, he pads his expense
account with fodder that the horses never smell, and
his payroll with the names of several hundred soldiers
that don’t exist.”</p>

<p>He showed me the newspaper account of a battle
wherein General Somebody-or-Other with a force of
four thousand men, had just defeated Villa in a
bloody engagement.</p>

<p>“Now I happened to see the General start on that
campaign. He had only two hundred men. And if
my suspicion is correct, he never met Villa. It was
a lot easier to sit down and write a telegram describing
an imaginary victory. The President cited him
for distinguished service, and he came home a hero.
Carranza does the same thing. Instead of cleaning
up the country, he just sends out reports telling the
rest of the world that Mexico is now at perfect
peace.”</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Eustace and I occupied our enforced sojourn at
Manzanillo by writing up the many stories we had
gleaned from the Old-Timers, and mailing them
home to newspaper editors.</p>

<p>If the American government still insisted most
stubbornly in giving Carranza a chance to make
good, the American public was waking up. Newspapers
were beginning to publish accounts of Mexican
outrages upon American citizens and their property.
The American press was commencing to expose
the Carranza régime.</p>

<p>So many were the stories coming up from Mexico
that readers were prepared to believe anything. In
fact, they were ready to believe too much. For the
news contained in the message we had dispatched
upon our arrival in Manzanillo&mdash;“Foster and
Eustace slain by bandits”&mdash;when disseminated by
the worthy Mr. Werner, traveled rapidly to the border,
and brought back to Manzanillo, from a former
associate of mine in Nogales, a telegram inquiring
about the details of our death.</p>

<p>Eustace and I regarded the whole affair as a joke.</p>

<p>We wrote my friend a joint letter, explaining that
we had merely been captured by Zamorra, and had
made our escape from his camp, after having
thrashed him and his fellow cut-throats with our
bare fists. And when at length the railway resumed
operation, and we could resume our journey to
Mexico City, we rode away, blissfully ignorant of
the future consequences of that absurd letter, rejoicing
that Manzanillo was a horror of the past.
Having attacked President Carranza consistently in
all our newspaper articles, we were eager to visit his
capital to learn whether he were really so bad as we
had pictured him.</p>

<p>It was another four days’ journey to Mexico City&mdash;a
journey directly eastward and a trifle skyward.</p>

<p>Mexico is a mountainous country&mdash;so loftily mountainous
that one has only to travel upward to pass
in turn through every variety of climate and every
type of landscape.</p>

<p>The road led from Manzanillo through the hot
coastal plain&mdash;through palm-land and swamp-land
where sweating, semi-naked <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peons</i> waded knee-deep
in pools formed overnight by the first downpour of
a tropic rainy season&mdash;to Colima, a conventional
little city at the base of a snow-tipped volcano&mdash;into
the highlands through tortuous defiles where
the cane gave way to maize and the jungle-growth to
cactus&mdash;past tiny villages of adobe huts clustering
about a huge white church that dwarfed the rugged
gullies&mdash;into a climate of eternal spring&mdash;to Guadalajara,
the second largest and the most delightful
city of the republic, where orange trees were golden
throughout the year&mdash;and beyond, to the wide expanses
of Mexico’s high plateau&mdash;to a land of vast,
gloomy spaces and lonely grandeur&mdash;the grandeur
of rolling yellow plains stretching to a distant
horizon rimmed with jagged peaks, where at twilight
the purple shadows crept upward toward an azure
sky&mdash;to a country desolate and superb, and a trifle
wintry.</p>

<p class="center space-above"><span class="figcenter" id="i_014">

<p class="center">THE ORANGE TREES IN GUADALAJARA’S PLAZA WERE GOLDEN
THROUGHOUT THE YEAR<br /></p>

<p>To the stay-at-home American, Mexico is only a
sun-scorched desert. In reality, it is a land of everything&mdash;of
sandy wastes, of rugged mountains, of
rank tropical jungles, of temperate valleys&mdash;of lowlands
bathed in moist tropic heat, of midlands where
strawberries are always ripe, even of highlands
swept eternally by chilling winds. Yet always there
is some intangible spirit about it that makes it unmistakably
Mexico, especially upon the bleak
plateau.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The haunting melancholy of the high altitude
seemed to have affected the natives.</p>

<p>Below, on the coast, the poverty-stricken Indians
had appeared contented and happy. On the tableland
they were very solemn. A <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peon</i> marching behind
his little burro wore the same stolid, pack-animal
expression as the beast itself. There was no
animation in the faces. The greater part of the
masculine population sat upon the station platforms,
wrapped in blankets and meditation, waiting only
for another day to pass.</p>

<p>The women, more energetic than the men, still
besieged the car windows, offering for sale the local
products, not in the cheery manner of the lowland
women, but hopelessly and mournfully, as though
they expected that no one would buy. Unimaginative
as the men-folks, they all sold the same article&mdash;whatever
article some more energetic ancestor,
many years before, had sold in their particular village.
At Irapuato it was strawberries; at Celaya a
species of fudge in tiny wooden boxes; at Queretaro
opals from the neighboring mines; at San Juan del
Rio lariats and ropes.</p>

<p>They waited in a bedraggled group as the train
pulled in. They all advanced toward the same window.
When the first customer did not buy, they
shrugged their shoulders and turned away. Gradually
it would dawn upon them that there were other
passengers, and they would drift out along the sides
of the other cars, holding up their baskets in mute
appeal.</p>

<p>“It is <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pulque</i>,” explained a Mexican fellow-passenger.
“They are all sodden with it here. <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Que
borachos!</i> What drunkards!”</p>

<p><i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Pulque</i>, the cheap liquor of the plateau, grows
only in the highlands, and sours too quickly to be
transported elsewhere. As we ascended toward the
7500-foot altitude of the capital, fields of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">maguey</i>&mdash;the
source of the beverage&mdash;became more and more
frequent until they lined the railway in long even
rows that covered the rolling plains to the distant
mountain-rim&mdash;each cactus resembling a huge blue
artichoke, and adding another touch of color to the
landscape. In blossoming, the plant sends up a tall
stalk from which, if it be tapped, there flows a milky
fluid locally known as “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">aguamiel</i>” or “honey-water,”
which ferments very rapidly. Within a few
hours it becomes a mild intoxicant with a taste like
that of sour buttermilk; within a few hours more it
becomes a murder-inspiring poison with a taste
which the most profane of mortals could never adequately
describe.</p>

<p>In the fields <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peons</i> could be seen, each with a pigskin
receptacle slung over his back, trotting from
plant to plant, climbing upon the pulpy leaves of the
big cactus as though he were some little bug crawling
into a flower, bending over the central pool to
suck the liquid into a hollow gourd, and discharging
it into the pigskin sack. When the bag was filled,
he would trot away to the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">hacienda</i> with it; a little
stale <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pulque</i> would start it fermenting; on the morrow
a series of early trains, the equivalent of the
milk trains elsewhere, would carry it to all the neighboring
cities to befuddle the population there.</p>

<p>Drunkenness is extremely common in Mexico.
Although <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pulque</i> can not be widely distributed, the
Mexicans boil the lower leaves of their cactus and
<span id="distill">distill</span> therefrom their <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mescal</i> and <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tequila</i>&mdash;two fiery
alcoholic stimulants condemned both by moralists
and by connoisseurs of good liquor&mdash;which are responsible
for most of the acts of violence which
transpire in the republic. Yet drunkenness is most
prevalent in the highlands, for <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pulque</i>, while comparatively
mild, is the cheapest thing in Mexico, and
one can buy a quart or two for a few pennies.</p>

<p>On each station platform the men sat patiently,
waiting while the women offered their wares. The
old girl probably would not make a sale, but <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">quién
sabe</i>? If she did, there would be more money for
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pulque</i>. Already sodden with it, they wrapped their
tattered blankets about them, and watched fatalistically,
inhabitants of the world’s richest country, resigned
to an empty life, oblivious to the charm of the
most fascinating country on all the earth.</p>

<p>For despite its gloom, I know of no country more
fascinating than the Mexican plateau.</p>

<p>In the clear mountain air each picturesque detail
of the vast landscape stood out distinctly&mdash;the
peaked hat of a little Indian plodding solemnly behind
his burro&mdash;a herd of cattle grazing leisurely
upon the coarse bunch-grass, mere brown specks
against the yellow hills&mdash;a lonely white chapel with
two slender towers and a massive dome, standing by
itself without the suggestion of a possible worshiper
within miles and miles&mdash;an infrequent <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">hacienda</i>
with a host of tiny laborers’ shacks grouped about
a crumbling ranch-house that once had been a palace.
Yet the indefinable charm of the scene lay not in the
details, but in the immensity of the canvas. Against
the majestic sweep of the wasteland itself, the details
appeared dwarfed and isolated. They gave one
a feeling of utter loneliness&mdash;even of sadness&mdash;a
strangely delicious sadness. A bleak, gloomy place
was this plateau, yet many years hence, whenever
one heard “Mexico,” one would think not of the
desert or the jungle, but of these vast stretches of
yellow wasteland and this horizon of purple mountains,
and one would sense a haunting desire to see
them again.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>After two days upon that plateau, Mexico City
was a shock.</p>

<p>The train roared into a crowded station. Vociferous
hotel runners burst into the car and fought up
and down the aisles. <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Cargadores</i> clamored outside
the windows. Mexican friends met Mexican friends
with loud cries of joy. All screamed noisily to make
themselves heard above the din of claxons from
riotous streets outside.</p>

<p>Some runner, having driven rivals away from
Eustace and myself, handed our suit-cases through
the window to a waiting desperado, and we chased
him frantically through the mob. Some chauffeur,
having driven rivals away from the suit-cases,
packed them inside a taxi, shoved us in after them,
and shot away at full speed the moment his assistant
cranked the car, leaving the assistant to dodge aside
and jump aboard as best he could, zigzagging madly
through a fleet of other taxis, all of which were
shrieking their claxons and roaring past with wide
open cut-out, avoiding a dozen clanging trolley cars
and scraping along the side of a thirteenth, pausing
momentarily while a rabid policeman waved his
arms and screamed abuse in voluble Spanish, then
tearing onward as wildly as before through a world
of leaping pedestrians.</p>

<p>We drew up with a grinding of brakes before a
modern hotel, the chauffeur collected a modern fare,
a hotel clerk grunted at us with modern incivility,
a bell-hop conducted us with modern condescension
to a modern room, and left us to spend a night of
modern wakefulness listening to the nerve-wracking
din of a thoroughly modern city outside.</p>

<p>After the plateau, it seemed profane. One had the
illusion that in the midst of a grand cathedral service
the bishop had given a college yell, the organ
had burst into jazz, and the choir had danced an
Irish jig.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>In the morning Eustace and I wrote President
Carranza a friendly little note, requesting an interview.
Then we set out to see the town.</p>

<p>It proved surprisingly attractive by daylight&mdash;one
of the most ornate in the Western Hemisphere
outside of Argentina or Brazil. If it lacked the
impressive solidity of an American city, and failed
to startle with giant sky-scrapers, it undoubtedly
surpassed New York or any other Yankee metropolis&mdash;including
Washington&mdash;in the beauty of its
parks and boulevards.</p>

<p class="center space-above"><span class="figcenter" id="i_015">
  <img src="images/015.jpg" class="w75"  alt="MEXICO CITY, ONE OF THE MOST ORNATE CAPITALS IN THE WESTERN

</span></p>
<p class="center">MEXICO CITY, ONE OF THE MOST ORNATE CAPITALS IN THE WESTERN
HEMISPHERE, SOMEWHAT RESEMBLED PARIS<br /></p>

<p>Superficially it suggested Paris. Along the streets
of its business section the buildings, all of the same
height of three or four stories, were of European
architecture. Its avenues and gardens, with their
numerous statues and monuments, were distinctly
French. There was a suggestion also of other lands.
There were German beer halls and rathskellers, dignified
English banks, Italian restaurants, and Japanese
curio shops. There was even the American
quick-lunch counter where a darky from Alabama
asked abruptly, “What’s yours, boss?” and shouted
“One ham sandwich!” through a wall-opening to a
white-capped cook. But French window-displays of
modes and perfumery predominated, and combining
with the architecture, gave the city the general aspect
of Paris.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>It proved a cool city, however, both in climate and
manners. Of the two, the former seemed the more
kindly. If the air were chilly at morning or evening&mdash;either
in summer or winter, wherein there is little
variation&mdash;it was hot enough at mid-day to bring
out the perspiration. But the manners remained
constantly those of all large cities, even in Mexico.</p>

<p>There was no reason that they should be otherwise.
After traveling, nevertheless, through smaller
towns, where natives looked upon a newcomer with
interest and other Americans immediately introduced
themselves, we found that we were regarding
the entire population of the capital as downright discourteous.
Americans upon the street were not
merely indifferent but suspicious. When we attempted
to stop one to inquire the way to the
National Museum, he would duck aside and hurry
away before we could speak. We had about decided
to punch the next fellow-countryman we met, and
were looking for a small one, when we discovered the
reason for American distrust.</p>

<p>Every fourth <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i> in town seemed to be broke
and in need of alms.</p>

<p>Two clean-cut youngsters, lured here evidently by
the illusion that any one could make his fortune in
Latin America, came into an American restaurant
where we lunched, and begged the proprietor for a
job washing dishes.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, man, we’re hungry! And we’re
willing to work! All we ask is our meals, and five
pesos a week to cover room rent&mdash;not a penny
more!”</p>

<p>The proprietor shook his head.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for them,” he said, as the youths went
out, “but there’s too many. They use up all your
sympathy.”</p>

<p>Another youth stopped us in the park.</p>

<p>“I’m not a regular bum,” he pleaded. “I came
down here because a fellow I knew invited me. He
was a Mexican, and he worked beside me in the auto
factory up at Detroit. He was always telling me
what a fine country this was. After he went home,
he kept writing to me about how when I came to
Mexico his house would be my house. I thought he
meant it. And he kept saying there were lots of
jobs. I didn’t know it was their habit to say nice
things like that just to please you. I came down here
three weeks ago, and there <em>were</em> no jobs&mdash;or else
Mexicans took them on a salary that wouldn’t support
an American&mdash;and when I looked up my friend,
he kept saying that his house was my house, but I’ve
never seen the inside of it, and since the first day I
haven’t seen <em>him</em>. I’ve spent my last cent, and I’m
up against it.”</p>

<p>But among the down and out were many less deserving,
with stories just as good. Some were draft-evaders
that had come to Mexico during the War,
and had been unable to return. Others were professional
vagabonds who had gravitated southward to
enjoy the privileges of a country that recognized
vagrancy as a legitimate profession. At first, like
most new arrivals touched by the pitiful sight of a
fellow-countryman in misfortune in a foreign land,
we gave liberally. But within a few days, we grew
hardened, and like the Old-Timers, we ducked away
at the very approach of a strange American, even
though he merely wished to ask his way to the National
Museum.</p>

<p>For companionship, we confined ourselves to Old
Barlow, who occupied the hotel room next to ours,
and who drifted into our quarters now and then to
gratify an Old Resident’s love of spinning yarns.</p>

<p>He was somewhat of a pessimist. He liked Mexico
but he always carried a gun. A gray-haired man,
walking with a slight limp, he claimed to have been
present at every earthquake, revolution, and dog-fight
that had ever transpired in Mexico or Central
America, and when once started on a recital, each
murder suggested another.</p>

<p>“Best thing I ever did see was the duel Cash Bradley
fought. Cash didn’t know nothing about swords,
so when this geezer challenged him, he went up to
ask General Agramonte for advice. Great old war-horse
was Agramonte! Says he, ‘You don’t need to
know nothing about swords&mdash;except one little trick
of swordsmanship I’m going to teach you. When
you first start, the seconds will count three, and at
each count you bring down your sword and clash
it politely with the other guy’s sword by way of
salute. Well, <span id="three">on the count of three</span>, you just accidentally
miss the other fellow’s sword and salute him
politely in the neck.’ And believe me, boys, that
little feat of swordsmanship just saved Cash Bradley’s
life.”</p>

<p>Then he would puff at his pipe, and muse a while.</p>

<p>“Great old war-horse, Agramonte! I remember
when he had a run-in with President Huerta, the
bird Carranza chased out. Huerta invited him up to
the Palace for tea, and when Agramonte was about
to leave, he says to him, ‘I’ve got forty soldiers on
the staircase, waiting to shoot you on your way
home.’ Agramonte didn’t blink an eyelash. He
just shoved his own gun into Huerta’s ribs, and
answers, ‘Then you’ll come with me, and if one soldier
raises a gun, you’ll die first.’ They walked
down the staircase, arm in arm, and kissed each
other good-by at the door, and not a soldier fired a
shot.”</p>

<p>Then he would muse again, rapturously, as though
recalling pleasant memories.</p>

<p>“Huerta was some war-horse himself. He used to
be a general in Madero’s army, until he suddenly
walked into the Palace, with his army behind him,
and told Madero to quit. Huerta was always a
great stickler for constitutionality, so he wanted
Madero to sign a proper resignation. And Madero
wouldn’t resign. Huerta heated the poker and
started to tickle him with it. You could see the blood
running out of Madero’s eyes, but he was stubborn
as a mule, and he just kept saying, ‘I’m the rightful
president of Mexico!’ Finally Huerta had to shoot
him. But he was a great stickler for constitutionality,
so he put Madero’s body in a coach, and took
it out for a ride and had his troops fire a volley on
the coach; then he told the world that Madero was
shot by his own men while fleeing the country. Some
one had to take the presidency then, so Huerta
took it. Great stickler for constitutionality was
Huerta!”</p>

<p>Another puff at his pipe.</p>

<p>“Carranza don’t do his own shooting, but he’s got
plenty of generals to do it for him. If I was you
boys, and had written some nasty things about the
Old Gent, like you say you have, I wouldn’t wait for
no interview. I’d take the next train to Vera Cruz,
and catch a boat.”</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>We waited for the interview. The chances
were that nothing we had written would ever be published.
If it were, Carranza would never know it.
And there was more of Mexico City to be seen.</p>

<p>If it bore a superficial resemblance to Paris, its
population remained distinctly Mexican.</p>

<p>In the early morning, upon the Avenida Francisco
I. Madero, the Mexican Fifth Avenue, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">boulevardiers</i>
were mostly Indians in blankets, and shop girls
hurrying to work with black shawls over their heads.
Gradually they gave way to people in European
dress, yet here and there in the crowd there passed an
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">hacendado</i> just in from his country estate and still
wearing riding boots and <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">sombrero</i> and a huge revolver
pendant from a heavy leather belt encircling
his ample girth. Then came the shoppers&mdash;stout,
overpowdered matrons with a flock of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señoritas</i> in
tow&mdash;all in Parisian garb, but unmistakably Mexican.
They came in handsome private cars, alighting
with the assistance of uniformed attendants, and
disappearing into the fashionable <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">modistes</i>’ establishments
with the grand aristocratic air of the
newly rich&mdash;for most of the city’s real aristocracy
had fled the country during the long series of revolutions,
and these were largely the wives and daughters
of the successful generals.</p>

<p>At noon, the streets became almost deserted, for
here as everywhere the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">siesta</i> was a ritual, but
later the crowd reappeared, and now for a brief
hour the Avenida did bear some true resemblance to
Paris. The womenfolk came out in their new finery,
and rolled up and down in their handsome cars to
display themselves. The men, having finished the
day’s work, loitered along the sidewalk, chatting merrily,
twiddling their canes, puffing at their cigarettes,
and keeping an attentive eye on passing femininity.
But at twilight, the womenfolk disappeared,
and the chill of evening brought an end to the atmosphere
of gayety. The men still loitered, but the attentive
eye was fixed now upon the shop girls that
hurried homeward.</p>

<p>“Why hasten, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">chiquita</i>?” they called after each
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mantilla</i>-muffled figure. “Come with me instead.”</p>

<p>Sometimes the male voices were serious. Usually
they were casual, as though merely performing the
rite&mdash;considered a sacred duty by the men of all
Latin America&mdash;of insulting the unchaperoned
woman. The girls were accustomed to it, and paid
no attention either to the words or to the nudges and
pinches that followed. Now and then there passed
a street-walker&mdash;an institution seldom seen in the
smaller Mexican cities, where vice is more carefully
segregated&mdash;and she invited with a concentrated
flash of eyes, but she did not speak, as might her
counterpart in Paris. Over the crowded streets
there hung an air of gravity&mdash;of Mexican gravity&mdash;the
gravity of the high plateau.</p>

<p>Darkness came. The men pulled up their coat
collars, pulled in their necks, and discussed the advisability
of a cocktail. Lights appeared in thick
clusters of glowing bulbs, as in the French capital,
but they shed a radiance that inspired no gayety.
The taxis still roared and rattled, and shot zigzag
through the streets like so many skating-bugs on a
millpond; the trolleys passed at thirty-foot intervals
incessantly clanging their gongs; the policemen at
each corner turned their “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Alto-Adelante</i>” or “Go-Stop”
signs first one way, then another, blowing
their shrill whistles first with one toot, then two
toots, and sending the traffic scurrying first in one
direction, then another; above the Avenida there
rose the grand discord of a busy metropolis; yet
Mexico City became merely noisy rather than lively.
Acquaintances embraced acquaintances demonstratively,
yet with an air of conventionality. The loitering
throngs before the blazing doorways of theaters
or cinemas were subdued and solemn. The street-walkers
invited with unsmiling eyes. The boulevardiers
withdrew, group by group, for their cocktails,
not to pleasant sidewalk cafés like those of Paris,
but to formal Spanish bar-rooms. By ten o’clock the
sidewalks were almost as empty as those of Hermosillo.
Only the flying taxis remained, dashing about
with screeching claxons as though crying vainly,
“This is Paris.”</p>

<p>It looked like Paris, and from a distance it sounded
like Paris, but the Parisian insouciance was missing.
This was still Mexico&mdash;the Mexico of the high
plateau.</p>

<p>Carranza not proving very prompt in answering
his correspondence, we amused ourselves with a visit
to the ancient pyramids of San Juan Teotihuacán&mdash;remnants
of what had been a mighty empire before
the Conquest&mdash;distant some twenty-eight miles from
the Capital.</p>

<p>A leisurely train carried us there in something
over an hour and a half. We descended at the station,
expecting to be pounced upon by a dozen professional
guides, but none molested us. Little barefoot
children with spurious relics were our only assailants.
We looked about for a conveyance and discovered
the Toonerville Trolley. An individual
asleep inside acknowledged that he was the conductor.
He proved also to be the motorman, for having
collected our fare, he aroused the mule, and the car
jogged slowly away with swaying gait through lanes
of cactus, toward the squatty figures of two pyramids,
deceitfully small with distance and dwarfed
by the mountains behind them.</p>

<p>But at length the cactus-hedge ceased, and upon
our right appeared the ruins of a temple&mdash;the Temple
of Quetzacoatl&mdash;a big square surrounded by
heavy ramparts of earth and stone, wherein a group
of workmen were restoring a wall lined with monster
demon-heads and gargoyles carved of solid rock.
And a few minutes later we were at the foot of the
pyramids, no longer small and dwarfed, but looming
skyward above us&mdash;pyramids which, if less imposing
in stature than those of Egypt, excel them in the
dimensions of their base, and may even antedate
them, according to the estimates of some archeologists,
by possibly a thousand or two thousand years.</p>

<p class="center">THE MEXICAN PYRAMIDS PROBABLY ANTEDATE THOSE OF EGYPT BY A
THOUSAND YEARS OR MORE<br /></p>

<p>Speculation as to just how old they really are has
kept many a scientist out of worse mischief, but
seems to have accomplished little else. Thanks to
the demolition by the fanatical Spaniards of the
heathen writings they found in the Americas, practically
nothing is known of their origin. It is believed
that they antedate the Toltecs, and that they
testify to the existence of an ancient race in Mexico,
long since vanished to who-knows-where, that once
surpassed in engineering skill and presumably in
civilization the early peoples of the other Hemisphere.</p>

<p>So little had we read of them, and so free did they
appear from exploitation as a tourist sight, that
Eustace and I experienced almost the joy of personal
discovery. But it was soon rudely shattered.
For up drove an automobile from Mexico City’s
leading hotel, and out climbed two other Americans.</p>

<p>They were recognizable immediately as Rotarians.
They were both good fellows. They had met at the
Regis, and in talking over business had discovered
that both by profession were Realtors. They had
found a mutual bond of interest in the fact that
Mexico City, although it <em>was</em> a better burg than they
had anticipated, had a less up-to-date garbage-disposal
system than Long Branch, N.J., or Newburyport,
Mass. They were now having a whale of a
time kidding the guide good-naturedly about the
shortcomings of his country, and were getting to
like each other better every minute. Next week,
upon their return home, each would tell his friends
about the good scout he bumped into down in Mexico,
and would exclaim, “It beats all how you meet
people! The world’s a pretty small place after
all!” And at Christmas, each would send the other
a card playfully addressed “Senor.”</p>

<p>“So that’s what you brought us out here to see!”
said the man from Long Branch.</p>

<p>The other drew out a guide-book and read:</p>

<p>“The pyramid of the Sun Tonatiuh Itzcuatl damn
this language anyhow a truncated artificial mound
216 feet high by about 721 and 761 feet at the base
divided into five pyramidal sections or terraces
which narrow as they ascend. Now that we’ve seen
that, where do we eat?”</p>

<p>We left them below while we started up the long
flight of stone steps that led up the five terraces of
the larger pyramid, The Sun. It had been partially
restored, and its surface of many-colored rocks, each
the size of a domesticated cobblestone, originally
held together with adobe, now gleamed white with
Portland Cement. Upon its lofty top, covered to-day
by a flat rock, there had once been a gigantic
statue of the Sun, cut from a block of porphyry, and
ornamented with gold. And here the Aztec priests
had probably plunged their arms into many a victim’s
breast, to draw out a beating heart, and toss
the body of the sacrifice down the steep rocky sides
to the wasteland beneath.</p>

<p>It was very quiet now, with the restful calm that
one finds only upon a mountain-top. One could look
down upon miles and miles of rolling plain dotted
with cactus of many shades of green, clustering
sometimes in prickly forests, stretching away in two
parallel lines to mark a trail, arranging themselves
in military rows to indicate a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pulque</i> hacienda, gathering
in a hedge about the low flat roof of an adobe
homestead. Here or there rose the unfailing spires
and dome of another lonely church. In the fields a
yoke of oxen, plowing a cornfield, seemed scarcely
to move. The sky above was of vivid blue, with
puffy white clouds along the horizon. Sounds
drifted up from the world below&mdash;the mooing of a
cow, the cackle of a hen, the tap of a hammer&mdash;each
very distinct, yet so softened by distance that it
seemed not to interrupt the silence&mdash;as though it
merely came from a far-away land wherewith one
had severed connection.</p>

<p>Then the two tourists came panting up the steps.</p>

<p>“Damn those stairs, anyway. They ought to have
a railing on each side.”</p>

<p>Eustace blandly suggested an elevator, but the
sarcasm was lost.</p>

<p>“We’d have one, if this was in Newburyport.
We’d have a regular train service out here, and
we’d put in a modern cafeteria. Boy, but you could
make money out of this thing, if you had it in the
United States! You could hire a bunch of Irishmen
and dress them up like Aztecs, have a couple of girls
doing an Indian dance on top, charge a fifty-cent admission&mdash;why,
man, you’d clean up a fortune!”</p>

<p>As we started down to catch the evening train back
to the taxi-screeching City of Mexico, Babbitt and
Kennicott were carving their initials on the flat rock
atop the Pyramid of the Sun.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>A week drifted past, and Sunday arrived.</p>

<p>On that, of all days, Mexico City was most typically
Mexican.</p>

<p>The aristocrats paraded themselves in the parks;
the middle-classes went picnicking; the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peons</i> went
to church.</p>

<p>We strolled out along the Avenida Madero, past
the National Opera House&mdash;said to be the handsomest
building of its kind on the continent, but still
with an unfinished dome because one administration
had started it, and others had neglected to provide
funds for its completion. Beyond it lay the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Alameda</i>,
the Mexican Central Park. It was a European
park, quite unlike the palm-grown <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plazas</i> of the
smaller cities, but there was the usual Mexican band
concert, and the people were renting camp-chairs
along the shady walks to enjoy the national pastime
of seeing and being seen.</p>

<p>Beyond the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Alameda</i>, commenced a wide boulevard,
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Paseo de la Reforma</i>, typically Parisian in
its wealth of monuments, and lined with handsome
embassies and residences, leading out to Chapultepec,
a larger and even more charming park, with
wide expanses of lawn and woodland and lake and
meadow surrounding the National Palace, a squatty
fortress-like structure pleasing in its effect of
strength and beauty, perched upon high cliffs
and glimpsed through the tree-tops as though it
hung suspended in the sky. The policemen here
were clad in Mexico’s <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">charro</i> costume&mdash;the costume
of the old grandees&mdash;with short buff jacket, skin-tight
blue trousers lined with rows of silver buttons, flowing
red tie, huge velvet <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">sombrero</i>, and a big gleaming
sword. An orchestra in similar costume held
forth beneath an awning near the lake, playing
sweetly upon a marvelous combination of guitars,
mandolins, marimbas, harps, cellos, oboes, and what
not. Automobiles rolled past along the winding
driveway, each filled with a bevy of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señoritas</i>.
Horsemen rode grandly past, dressed also in <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">charro</i>
costume, and mounted upon the finest steeds in
Mexico. Pedestrians idled beside the lake, watching
the procession, and listening to the orchestra, with
that rare enjoyment of really good music that characterizes
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peon</i> and aristocrat alike. Here, as in the
small-town plaza, the Mexicans were finding a pleasure
in their park such as no American ever finds in
the parks of the United States. Here, as everywhere
in Mexico, a public garden was not merely a place for
the perambulation of baby carriages by nursemaids,
but an institution of which even society took full
advantage.</p>

<p>Having seen the aristocrats in action, we caught
a trolley out to the floating gardens of Xochimilco
to observe the middle-class picknickers. It was a
profanely modern trolley, with a “No Spitting”
sign, and rimmed with lurid posters from which
“Wrigley” and “Colgate” peeped out from a conglomeration
of Spanish, and it carried us through
streets whose buildings were defaced either by
countless advertisements or countless warnings not
to post advertisements. But presently it left the
city behind, and raced out through maize-fields and
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">maguey</i> fields, and dropped us at a quaint little town,
complete even to cathedral-fronted <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>.</p>

<p>Tiny children, their arms laden with flowers, surrounded
us, sticking bouquets into our buttonholes
and pockets, and pleading for “a little <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">centavito</i>.”
They were irresistible. Dressed exactly like their
elders in long skirts and mantillas, and with the
mature air characteristic of Mexican children, they
seemed like little dwarfed adults. Their voices were
caressing, and they would retreat whenever we tried
to return their bouquets without purchasing.</p>

<p>“Ah, no, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>! Buy them from me! A little
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">centavito</i>, no more!”</p>

<p>Looking rather like floating gardens ourselves, we
drifted toward the canals. These were the remnants
of the great network of waterways that the Spanish
conquistadores saw when first they entered the
Valley of Mexico. In those days, before Modern
Progress decreed that the Valley should be drained,
Mexico City was a Venice, upon whose lakes there
floated rafts of interlaced twigs, covered with rich
soil, and blossoming with flowers. Xochimilco was
the last survival of the Aztec floral paradise, and it
proved distinctly disappointing.</p>

</span></p>
<p class="center">IN THE GARDENS OF XOCHIMILCO, RELICS OF AN AZTEC PARADISE,
ONLY THE CABBAGES WERE IN BLOOM<br /></p>

<p>A barefoot boatman met us, holding up a piece of
paper upon which was written in English, “Do you
want one bot? I have a fin bot.”</p>

<p>He led us to a dugout canoe, with an awning supported
by vine-laced framework, and paddled us out
through a canal where native women were washing
clothes or cleaning chickens, under a bridge emblazoned
with “Drink Moctezuma Beer,” and along
a waterway lined with decaying rafts covered with
a luxuriant growth of carnations, cane, eucalyptus,
and cabbages, of which only the last-named seemed
to be in bloom. Parties of picknickers drifted past
us in larger boats, each with a table in the center, at
which every one was busily eating. Along the way
were restaurants and refreshment rooms, each with
an orchestra of one fiddle, one guitar, and one bass-drum,
which started to play at our approach and
quit as soon as we passed, the bass-drummer invariably
outspeeding and outdrowning his collaborators.
The final exhibit, at the far end of the canal, was the
city waterworks.</p>

<p>We came back to the churches to see the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peons</i>.</p>

<p>At the central Zocalo, or main <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>, a rather
dusty square with a few bedraggled palm trees,
where once had stood an Aztec pyramid, there now
stands the famous Cathedral of Mexico. Mexicans
will inform one that it is the largest and handsomest
cathedral in the hemisphere, although it is much
smaller than the Peruvian Cathedral, and one of the
least handsome churches in Mexico itself. There are
really two edifices, joined together like the Siamese
twins; each with a façade of elaborately carved gray
sandstone against a background of cracked red
basalt, pierced by many little windows in which repose
mildewed green bells.</p>

<p>This, essentially, is the church of the common
people. Society attends a more exclusive church on
the Avenida Madero, where the women (always
devout) go inside to mass, and the men (usually agnostic)
remain at the gate to ogle them as they make
their exit. There one finds the dim light, the subdued
air, and the solemnity of churches in other
lands. There is none of it in the Cathedral.</p>

<p>Everything in the huge edifice was bright and
gaudy and noisy. Many windows flooded it with
light. Glittering gilt ornamentation was everywhere.
The priests wore green and yellow robes.
The choir sang enthusiastically and loudly, without
evidence of training, as though each would outsing
his fellows both in volume and speed. Services were
proceeding simultaneously in both halves of the institution,
and each seemed trying frantically to
drown out the other.</p>

<p>Yet this, offensive even to one of mediocre taste,
impressed the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peons</i> for whom it was intended.
They knelt at the door and lighted their candles.
Then they crept forward upon their knees&mdash;ragged
little brown devils, unwashed, unshaven, and unlaundered&mdash;many
of them still a trifle <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pulque</i>-sodden
from a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">fiesta</i> of the night before. This noise and
display thrilled them as no solemn service could
thrill them. As they crept forward, with arms extended,
expressions of rapt ecstasy almost ennobled
their villainous faces. Their sins were forgiven!
To-morrow, with that odd mixture of idealism and
materialism so characteristic of their race, they
would start sinning again with a clean conscience.</p>

<p>These ragged little devils were the pawns of a
long series of revolutions. To-day, while the successful
generals rode grandly through Chapultepec,
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peons</i> who had won their battles and gained
nothing turned to the Cathedral for solace. One
might not believe in their religion, but one was
forced to admit that they found comfort. And certainly
they needed it.</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>To avoid religion as a delicate subject, as most
writers do, is to ignore a most important phase of
Mexican life.</p>

<p>In Mexico, even more than in most parts of Latin
America, the Church has been obliged, to the regret
of many of its own clergymen, to sacrifice much of
its dignity. It came originally to a land which
already possessed a religion consisting solely of barbaric
rites. It was adopted by a people whose conception
of things ecclesiastic was limited to the
meaningless observance of pagan ceremonials. And
these people, as a whole, to-day attend mass and
march about in procession without any very definite
idea of what the Church means, in much the same
fashion as in days of old they followed their Aztec
priests. Even in more intelligent circles, the Church
must cater to a racial mind which concerns itself not
with substance but with form and cares little about
creed or doctrine so long as it can maintain outward
appearances by elaborate ceremony. And since the
rank and file of the clergy come from the same sort
of people, the Church in Mexico has become largely
theatrical.</p>

<p>Religion, in short, caters here to a primitive mind.
It has many difficulties wherewith to contend. Because
its earliest leaders were gaining such authority
among the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peons</i>, the government placed severe
restrictions upon them. To-day no foreign priest is
allowed to conduct services. No native priest may
appear upon the street in clerical garb. No collections
may be taken at mass. No church may own its
property, which the government holds and permits it
to use. And church bells may ring but one minute
out of every hour.</p>

<p>Yet the clergy still has a tremendous hold upon
the people. It abides by the letter of the law. The
bells ring for one minute only, but they ring loudly
and with rapid strokes. The churches, although no
collections are taken, are filled with boxes for offerings.
Mexico is covered with chapels and shrines,
religious holidays number about three hundred and
sixty-five a year, and the custom of pilgrimage is
well established. Practically the entire population
professes the Catholic faith.</p>

<p>Of all the many shrines, that of Guadalupe, the
patron saint of Mexico, is the most popular. According
to legend, a poor Indian on his way to mass
met the Virgin Mary at this spot, and was sent to
the Bishop with the command that a church should
be erected here. When the Bishop was incredulous,
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peon</i> brought him a bunch of roses plucked from
a barren hillside. Convinced that a miracle had
transpired, the Bishop erected the church, and it became
at once so popular that a deluge of miracles
swept all over Mexico, and every other good friar
erected a chapel. But none has ever rivaled that of
Guadalupe.</p>

<p>It is situated only a brief distance from the capital.
A trolley took Eustace and myself there, stopping
at a small square filled with rude stands
under improvised awnings where Indians sold soft
drinks, beads, edibles, and candles. Before the
square stood a church and a merry-go-round. Above
it, reached by a long flight of winding stone steps,
there stood a small white chapel.</p>

<p>On each step sat a crippled beggar, seemingly a
poor advertisement for a shrine that purports to
heal all ailments. Yet the Mexicans saw no inconsistency
in this, and no irreverence in the merry-go-round
nor in the host of tin-type photographers who
had set up their stands upon the vestibule of the
church. Many of the Indians who pilgrimaged here
had come from the farthest ends of the republic,
making the journey on foot, and supporting themselves
by plying along the way whatever trade they
possessed. Most of them sold trinkets, and were
now selling them at the shrine itself.</p>

<p>The flight of steps was long and steep. On certain
holidays, the faithful were accustomed to ascend it
slowly upon their knees. In the high altitude, it
was sufficiently arduous to walk up. But the little
chapel on the hilltop was white and clean and simple.
Behind it lay a very peaceful, fragrant cemetery,
neatly kept, with many flowers. One wall was honeycombed
with tiny little alcoves, where one might rent
“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Nichos para restos perpetuedad $100.00</i>”&mdash;“permanent
niches for corpses at 100 pesos”&mdash;or niches
to be paid for by the year or month, with the penalty,
in case of non-payment, of seeing the ancestral bones
consigned to the scrap-heap. But there were graves
and tombs as well, many of them so handsome as to
suggest that even while Guadalupe, like the Cathedral,
was mainly a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peon</i> institution, the aristocrats
sometimes came here after death.</p>

<p>Descending by another long flight of steps, we
came to the Chapel of the Well&mdash;another small
chapel under a big dome of glittering tiles, containing
a well of curative waters. Ecstatic <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peons</i>, their
faces shining with joy, were lowering a bucket and
drinking, seizing the receptacle from one another’s
hands in their eagerness. At a near-by counter,
where crosses were sold, and ribbons marked with
the measure of the Virgin’s head or feet, one might
also obtain empty bottles&mdash;some of them still bearing
unhallowed labels&mdash;and these the natives filled at
the well for their fellow-villagers at home.</p>

<p>Turning around the corner, we came back to the
larger church. In its cellar was the evidence of the
cures effected. There was the usual pile of crutches
to be seen in all healing shrines. The wall was covered
with letters of thanks, letters accompanied invariably
with pictures, as though their authors, who
in their inability to read or write had been forced to
dictate their messages to a professional scribe, assumed
that their Benefactor was equally illiterate.
Many of them were from supplicants who could not
reach the shrine, describing their troubles and begging
assistance. The illustrations showed them being
run over by a trolley-car, shot in battle, caught
between two colliding steam engines, massacred in
other startling fashions or confined to a gloomy sick-bed.
There was one of papa looking out from between
prison bars, with a note from the family asking
the Virgin to soften the heart of the Magistrate.
And there was one from a very pretty young girl,
inclosing her photograph, and thanking the Virgin&mdash;with
an absence of detail that piqued one’s curiosity&mdash;for
having given her what she most desired. The
writing was frequently illegible, the words misspelled,
and the paintings execrably done by the
very worst of artists. Yet groups of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peons</i>, surveying
them, murmured their admiration of the bright
coloring, and exclaimed aloud with astonishment at
the marvelous cures.</p>

<p>No other church could so satisfy the Mexican <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peon</i>.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>We came back from Guadalupe to find a uniformed
Staff-Officer awaiting us. Old Barlow was
entertaining him in our absence.</p>

<p>The officer was a young man, in neat-fitting blue
uniform, and he had keen, sharp features. He wore
a little black mustache, like that of the villain from
a melodrama. He was suavely polite.</p>

<p class="center">MEXICAN POLICEMEN IN WHITE SPATS<br /></p>

<p>“Mario Sanchez, aide to his excellency, Venustiano
Carranza, President of the Republic of Mexico,
at your service, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señores</i>!”</p>

<p>We bowed. There was a cool reserve about
him that told us he did not expect to be kissed.</p>

<p>“You are the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Señores</i> Foster and Eustace, I believe,
the authors of these newspaper articles that I
here display?”</p>

<p>We stared in amazement at a sheaf of clippings
which he held before us. Our writings had been published!
The news of our death, followed by a letter
describing our heroic escape from Pedro Zamorra,
had brought us fame! We were headlined
on front pages! And our articles about Mexico had
all found a market! We were successful free-lance
newspaper correspondents!</p>

<p>“But where on earth did you get them?” demanded
Eustace, incredulously.</p>

<p>The officer smiled.</p>

<p>“My government keeps a careful check upon
writers who discuss our administration in the United
States. And you have honored us with a request
for an interview. It is customary, of course, that
such requests come through the American Embassy,
but in this case, we are very pleased that it has not.
President Carranza will grant the interview on one
condition&mdash;that you tell not the Embassy you are
coming. To-morrow evening, I shall call for you,
but you must come with me, very quietly, to the
Palace, telling no one. I can not now explain. But
it is very important that you tell no one. Until to-morrow
evening, at the eight o’clock. <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Adios, señores.</i>
I am your humble servant.”</p>

<p>With another deep bow, he withdrew.</p>

<p>We turned, mystified, to Old Barlow. He was
strangely nervous.</p>

<p>“Pack your suit-cases and beat it!” he advised.
“I know these devils&mdash;polite as they can be, and
damned likeable, but don’t you trust them. You
heard him say, ‘Tell no one!’ He’ll take you away
in a car, and not a soul on earth will ever see you
again, or learn what’s happened to you. So beat it
just as fast as you can!”</p>

<p>We packed our suit-cases. We bade each other
farewell. Eustace was determined to go back to
Manzanillo, and catch a boat to San Francisco. I
was determined to go to Vera Cruz, catch a boat for
Cuba, and see something more of Latin America before
I returned home. Only one thing was certain.
The expedition had reached a temporary halt.</p>

<small>INTERMISSION</small></h2>
</div>




<h3>I</h3>

<p>There was nothing thrilling about my escape
from Mexico. I simply rode down the railway
to Vera Cruz, boarded a steamer without
molestation, and sailed away.</p>

<p>The reflection that I was now a fugitive gave me
a sense of international importance. It did seem a
trifle uncomplimentary on the part of the Mexican
government that no one sought to interfere with my
departure. Still, there are some little slights that
one is willing to overlook, especially if one be a
fugitive.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Fellow travelers were always interested in my
story.</p>

<p>Occasionally I ran across persons who had heard
of my thrilling escape from the bandit camp of
Pedro Zamorra. They demanded details. They
were so insistent that it would have been a shame to
disappoint them. I licked bandit after bandit for
their benefit until completely fatigued.</p>

<p>Then, having begun to lose my original pride at
the fictitious exploit, I adopted a policy of modest
silence. Or I admitted, “That was all bunk!” This
seemed to make it the more convincing.</p>

<p>“He’s reticent,” they said, “like all great
heroes.”</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Inspired by this success, I decided to quit free-lancing
and become a fiction writer. I set out to
roam the world in search of material. Since editors
seldom bought the fiction I wrote, I roamed mostly
on foot.</p>

<p>In various odd corners of the globe, I found other
people who once had lived in Mexico. Most of them
had fled the country during the long series of revolutions.
Their property had been destroyed. In some
cases their loved ones had been murdered. Yet I
discovered&mdash;at first to my amazement&mdash;that they
were all dreaming of the day when conditions would
become settled, and permit them to return.</p>

<p>“Why?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. There’s <em>something</em> about
that country. You can’t explain it.”</p>

<p>I wandered through the West Indies&mdash;to South
America&mdash;to the Orient. I found many lands more
colorful than Mexico, where native customs were
more interesting, where foreigners were more welcome.
Yet I found none that I liked so well, except
Costa Rica, its Central-American neighbor. There
gradually came to me a haunting desire to return.
And when Carranza gave place to Obregon, and
Obregon proceeded to restore peace and order, I
packed my suit-case for another trip to Mexico&mdash;and
to the other little republics to the southward.</p>

<p>“Why?” asked every one at home.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. There’s something about that
country. You can’t explain it.”</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>My return was as uneventful as my flight.</p>

<p>I rather expected each Mexican I met to exclaim,
“So you’re the fellow that wrote all those dastardly
things about my country!” Apparently a few had
forgotten my articles. The others had not heard of
them.</p>

<p>I landed at Vera Cruz, and went up to the capital
over the same railway&mdash;up through gorges luxuriant
with forests of banana, past the snow-capped peak
of Orizaba looming mistily out of the clouds, through
tunnels and over bridges, along mountain sides
where one looked down upon checkerboard farms as
though one glimpsed them from an airplane, across
the magnificent plateau where yellow wasteland
stretched away to a purple horizon, and into the roar
and bustle of Mexico City.</p>

<p>The capital had changed but little. If anything,
it was noisier than before. Advertising posters defaced
every wall. The taxis had multiplied like
guinea pigs. Radios added a new note to the discord
of modern progress. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señoritas</i> had bobbed
their hair. Old Barlow alone remained the same.</p>

<p>I stopped just long enough to make inquiries about
Eustace. Since our parting, over four years ago, I
had never heard a word from him.</p>

<p>“No one has!” said Old Barlow. “You were the
lucky one that time. The other lad just disappeared&mdash;like
I predicted both of you would. Just vanished,
God knows where!”</p>

<p>I went back down the railway to Córdoba, to continue
southward alone through Mexico and Central
America.</p>

<small>THE LAND OF THE INDIAN VAMPS</small></h2>
</div>




<h3>I</h3>

<p>The railway southward into the Isthmus of
Tehuantepec was the worst in Mexico.</p>

<p>It had been constructed back in the days
of Diaz, and apparently had not been repaired since
that time. A rusty engine that wheezed with asthma
dragged behind it a long succession of splintered
freight cars, followed by an aged wooden passenger
coach whose walls groaned and protested at every
jolt, and swayed sidewise until the roof threatened
to fall.</p>

<p>From Córdoba, on the main line, the track
squirmed away with snake-like course into the tropical
jungles of the coastal plain. At times it passed
a pineapple farm or a banana plantation; usually it
ran through unbroken forest. The vegetation was
riotous. Moss covered the trees, plants sprouted
from the moss, vines crept upward among the plants
and dropped their creepers from the limbs, and a
thousand other varieties of parasitic growths twined
upward along the creepers. The rampageous wilderness
encroached upon the track so aggressively
that a passenger could not lean from the car windows;
it grew up between the tracks, and sprouted
from holes in the rotting ties.</p>

<p>Our progress was leisurely. First a freight car
jumped the rail. We waited three hours while the
engine left us and sought a wrecking crew. Then, as
soon as the wrecking crew had corrected the difficulty
and departed, the same car did the same thing,
and continued to repeat, until we reached a siding,
where the trainmen left it with all its contents,
presumably to rot in the jungle.</p>

<p>Then there was more delay. Another train was
expected from the opposite direction, but no one
seemed to know just where we might meet it, so the
engineer proceeded cautiously. We met it head-on
at a dangerous curve, both engines stopping with a
shriek of brakes, and bumping gently. The two
train crews then engaged in heated argument as to
which should back up ten miles to the nearest station
to let the other pass. There was speculation among
the passengers as to whether the debate would be
settled with knives or by a pushing match between
the two engines. The conductors finally tapped a
telegraph wire, and consulted headquarters, and received
a decision in favor of our own train. Thereupon
the other backed, very slowly as though to
maintain its dignity and give us as little satisfaction
as possible, and ours followed a few feet behind,
both engineers hurling Mexican curses at each other
from the car windows.</p>

<p>As always, the native passengers took things with
fatalistic unconcern. They expected to miss connections
at Rio Blanco, and be another day or two
upon their journey, but they merely shrugged their
shoulders. One must take things as they come in
travel, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>! So far, this had been an unusually
good trip. Cars always jumped the rail on this line.
It was not extraordinary to be stranded eighteen
hours or so in the jungle here, without food and
water&mdash;unless one took the precaution, observed by
the more experienced travelers, of bringing provisions.
They shrugged their shoulders again, lighted
their cigarettes, and amused themselves at each
delay by setting up a beer bottle in the jungle, and
shooting at it with their big revolvers, which seemed
to be quite as essential a part of a Mexican’s equipment
to-day as in the more turbulent times of Carranza.</p>

<p>And, as always in Mexico, everything turned out
all right. Although we crawled into Rio Blanco five
hours late, it developed that the connecting train had
been similarly delayed. There was a hurried lunch
at a railway restaurant, where the waitresses had
been blonds before the local supply of peroxide
gave out but now wore the Princeton colors. Then
the journey proceeded upon another line, which, if
possible, was worse than the one before.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>In the days of Diaz, the Mexican railways had
been built by Americans, and were under American
management.</p>

<p>They had now become a political football, however,
operated by the government not because they
were thus more profitable or efficient, but because
they thus offered employment to deserving voters.
The railway men, of course, knew something of railroading,
and the Vera-Cruz-Mexico-City road&mdash;as
well as the other more important roads&mdash;was kept in
repair. But the Obregon government, although an
improvement over its predecessors, was still maintaining
itself by force, and after paying its generals,
had little money left for keeping in order such railways
as those that meandered through its southern
jungles.</p>

<p>President Obregon’s term was drawing to a close;
there was soon to be an election; there had never
been an election in Mexico without a revolution; in
view of the forthcoming excitement, work of any
kind was practically at a standstill. An escort of
troops was still to be seen on every train&mdash;better-uniformed
and equipped than in the days of Carranza,
but with the same villainous faces. And a
garrison was lined up at the platform of each hamlet
through which we passed&mdash;a small garrison, so that
towns could be classified as one, two, three, four, or
five soldier towns&mdash;a mere handful of men, but
always present.</p>

<p>Conditions had improved during my four years’
absence from the country, but the land was by no
means so pacific and prosperous as Obregon’s propaganda&mdash;circulated
widely through the United States
at the moment when Obregon was seeking recognition
by our State Department&mdash;had led Americans
to believe. Mexico was still Mexico.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>It was quiet, and peaceful, and sunny, however, as
always.</p>

<p>This southern Mexico was a paradise of tropic
luxuriance. On the infrequent banana plantations
the foliage was so thick that the tunnels beneath the
trees were black as night. The jungle not only
slapped the face of any passenger who poked his
head from the window; it even scratched along the
sides of the car, seeking an opportunity to reach inside
and stick a thorn into the passenger’s eye.</p>

<p>The air was hot and moist. Inhabitants had reduced
clothing to a minimum. Naked children ran
races with the engine. The ox-drivers, leading their
patient yokes with a barbed pole, wore only a straw
hat, a pair of pants, and a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">machete</i>&mdash;a big two-bladed
knife&mdash;wherewith to hack their way through
the undergrowth. The women were garbed in what
appeared to be a thin, loose-flowing nightgown. The
houses were of cane and thatch, festering usually in
pools of filth. Swarms of pigs came out at each
stopping-place to nose about in search of the melon-rinds
or fruit-skins that passengers might contribute
to their welfare. The people, lolling usually in hammocks
of grass-rope, surveyed us with interest, but
made little effort to sell us anything.</p>

<p>Here was the true languor of the tropics, and the
train conformed. We were supposed to reach Santa
Lucrecia, the next transfer-point, at 8.30 in the
evening, but in this country a railway schedule is
much like a party platform in the United States.
Night descended. Dew saturated the jungle, and the
branches swishing past the windows sprinkled every
one inside the car. A golden moon peeped out from
a rank mass of silver clouds, and flitted through the
palm-fronds for hour after hour. There was a brief
halt at another railway restaurant, where a sleepy
proprietor had given up all hope of the train’s arrival.
He brought out cold rice, and heated coffee.
Milk, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>? <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Ay</i>, but although there were cows, the
people here did not bother to milk them. If one
wished to buy a can of condensed milk, yes, but it
was expensive in this country.</p>

<p>We finally crawled into Santa Lucrecia at 2.40 the
next morning. A boy led me upstairs to a room in
the station hotel. There was a canvas cot there with
a sheet badly soiled. But, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>, it had been washed
only last week! And its occupants since that time
had all been white persons, except one! The boy’s
tone implied, “What more do you want?” So I
turned in, and fell promptly asleep, lulled by the
scratching of cockroaches upon the wall. And here&mdash;alone
of all the station stops I found in Mexico&mdash;one
could sleep late the next morning, for the train,
instead of starting at sun-up, did not leave for Tehuantepec
until noon.</p>

<p>Santa Lucrecia was a straggling village of tin and
thatch, perched upon stilts as a precaution against
the floods of the rainy season, its several houses connected
by ramshackle board walks. Although in the
center of the isthmus, it had an altitude of only
twenty-six meters above the sea; its air was dank
and humid and depressing. Its inhabitants lived on
the porch, usually in hammocks, which, although not
completely bug-proof, gave the insects the trouble
of scaling a wall and finding their way across a hook
before they could reap their harvest. All intimate
daily functions were performed in public, preferably
on some conspicuous knoll or hilltop, as though the
town were eager to proclaim itself a formidable rival
in filth and vileness to Manzanillo.</p>

<p>But my fellow passengers were cheerful.</p>

<p>“It is a frightful place,” they agreed. “But wait,
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>, wait! To-night you shall be at Tehuantepec&mdash;in
the land of marvelous women! So big, so strong,
so beautiful! They do all the work, while a man has
but to lie in the shade and rest. <span id="Tehuan">You will like</span>
Tehuantepec, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>!”</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The noon train carried me over a better road,
across a range of mountains, and down the sandy
slopes of the Pacific coast, into an oasis of waving
coco-palms, and dropped me in the city of the far-famed
Indian vamps.</p>

<p>The entire female population was lined up at the
station, each with a basket of cocoanuts.</p>

<p>I had already heard much about their attractiveness,
for every travel writer makes it a point to rave
about them. They are described always as “sloe-eyed
queens of the tropics, with the figures of a golden-bronze
Venus, clad in oriental garments of vivid
color that do not quite meet at the waist.” They are
said to be of passionate and jealous nature. But for
several years I had been hearing, throughout my
travels, of women somewhere just ahead who were
like that, wherefore I was not surprised, upon descending
to the station platform at Tehuantepec, to
discover that the far-famed beauties were smoking
eight-inch cigars.</p>

<p>A few of the younger ones were handsome. Their
skin was a light brown, their eyes large and dark,
their hair long and jet-black, their teeth white and
regular, their lips red and sensual. They were a
trifle larger than most tropical Indians, with magnificent,
sturdy figures. But at least two-thirds of
them were pock-marked. And although they wore
the costume described&mdash;a little jacket of brilliant
color, and a short skirt also of brilliant hue&mdash;most of
the garments <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">did</i> meet at the waist, and those that
showed a brief strip of Tehuana lady were worn by
extremely aged Tehuana lady, and were not at all romantic.
For what was sturdiness in the younger
maidens became monstrous bulk in their elders.
They were majestically fat, solidly fat, with a weight
that must have amounted to three hundred pounds
each. The writers had told the truth about their
figures. They had all the truck-horse characteristics
of the Venus de Milo herself.</p>

<p>I looked upon them with awe. I stood for a moment
upon the platform, reviewing the stories I had
heard of their passionate nature, and their aggressiveness
toward the males who fell into their
clutches. And even as I reviewed these stories, the
women, having seen me, made a concerted rush. But
having surrounded me, they merely removed their
eight-inch cigars from their far-famed lips, and
chorused:</p>

<p>“Buy my cocoanuts, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>! Two cocoanuts for
five cents!”</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>A barefoot youth came to my rescue, shouldered
my suit-case, and led the way to Tehuantepec’s one
hotel.</p>

<p>Tehuantepec, although the largest city in population
on the Isthmus, is merely a big Indian village.
Its streets are sometimes rudely cobbled, but usually
of sand. It lies in a wide, fertile valley, straddling
a shallow river. In the center its buildings are of
heavy white stucco roofed with red tile. Elsewhere
its dwellings are of thatch, and straggle up the surrounding
mountain cliffs or out among the vast
groves of waving coco-palms. None of the merchants
have bothered to advertise on their shops the
nature of their business, for travelers seldom come
there, and the natives all know one another and one
another’s occupation, which is usually that of selling
cocoanuts to one another.</p>

<p>There is a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>, but it is a very inferior <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>,
fronted by a ramshackle church. In towns where
there is an element of Spanish blood, this would be
the center of all activity. But Tehuantepec is of
almost pure Indian population, and its interests are
in the native market.</p>

<p>When Cortez first came to Mexico, he and his followers
were amazed at the size of the Indian markets.
To-day no village is so tiny but that it has a
public square devoted to bartering, even though it
may have nothing else. Usually it is a stone-paved
courtyard beneath a sheet-iron roof. From the
rafters hang raw-hide thongs, lassos, saddles,
gaudy blankets, bunches of bananas, and miscellaneous
drygoods. The entire floor is covered with great
heaps of Indian pottery, jugs and pots and kettles
of earthenware. Tables, arranged in long rows, are
laden with piles of big round cakes resembling maple
sugar, with gravelly hills of flour, salt, spaghetti,
beans, and corn, with strings of red or green peppers,
slabs of meat, bleary-eyed fish, and everything
else imaginable. Flies swarm everywhere.
Turkeys are tied to the posts that support the roof.
Ducks and chickens, their legs hobbled or broken,
lurch from side to side in a futile effort to gain their
feet. Dogs slink through the crowd. Buzzards hop
about the floor. The whole effect is of confusion and
bedlam.</p>

<p class="center space-above"><span class="figcenter" id="i_019">
  <img src="images/019.jpg" class="w75"  alt="NO LATIN-AMERICAN VILLAGE IS SO TINY BUT THAT IT HAS A SQUARE

</span></p>
<p class="center">NO LATIN-AMERICAN VILLAGE IS SO TINY BUT THAT IT HAS A SQUARE
DEVOTED TO BARTERING<br /></p>

<p>The Mexican loves the noise and excitement of
such a place. So ingrained is his fondness for it that
a native on his way to market will sometimes refuse
to sell his goods for any price along the road. In the
few shops outside the square, the clerks are listless;
in the market, every one is animated. People selling
the same articles group themselves together, for it
stimulates competition. Let a potential purchaser
stop before one woman to glance at <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tortillas</i>, and a
dozen other <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tortilla</i>-vendors hiss to attract attention.
Here rules the great game of cheat-as-cheat-can.
There is no credit. There is no mutual confidence.
The merchant tests each coin; the purchaser tests
each purchase. Women buying hens ruffle up the
feathers and examine the bird carefully. Every one
watches the scales. And every one enjoys it hugely.</p>

</span></p>
<p class="center">THE MEXICAN PEON SO LOVES THE EXCITEMENT OF THE MARKET
THAT HE REFUSES TO SELL HIS GOODS ELSEWHERE<br /></p>

<p>But nowhere in Mexico is there a market more
animated than that of Tehuantepec.</p>

<p>It is essentially a feminine market. Years ago,
the men of the Isthmus were practically annihilated
in local warfare. For a long time the women outnumbered
them by a ratio of five to one; they
learned to do their own work; men became to them
a luxury rather than a necessity; and to-day the position
of the sexes&mdash;most strangely, in Mexico&mdash;has
become completely reversed. In most markets,
women predominate. In Tehuantepec so few males
are evident that a visitor strolling among the counters
feels like Al Jolson surrounded by the Winter
Garden chorus.</p>

<p class="center space-above"><span class="figcenter" id="i_021">
  <img src="images/021.jpg" class="w50"  alt="THE TEHUANA MAIDENS REGARDED A MAN AS A LUXURY

</span></p>
<p class="center">THE TEHUANA MAIDENS REGARDED A MAN AS A LUXURY
RATHER THAN A NECESSITY<br /></p>

<p>It was very clean&mdash;as compared with similar bartering
places elsewhere. Usually such places were
overpowering in their odor of sweaty femininity. In
Tehuantepec, however, the ladies were addicted to
a daily bath, the prettier and younger ones taking it
after dark, the elder ones in broad daylight, when
they were to be seen disporting their massive bulks
in the river that intersected the town, quite untroubled
by the attention they received from the military
garrison on the neighboring railway bridge.</p>

<p>Despite the comparative scarcity of males, the
usual number of babies were in evidence. Each
market-woman had an infant slung over her shoulder
in a gayly-colored <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">reboso</i>&mdash;the invaluable Mexican
shawl, which serves as towel, handkerchief,
wrap, carry-all for bringing produce home, and also
as a crib. While mother bargained, she fed her offspring.
The loose vest-like jacket was designed for
such an operation, as was the alternative garment,
a low-cut lace-frilled chemise. And she fed her offspring
mechanically, without once taking her attention
from the business of haggling. A quick jerk of
one shoulder, and the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">reboso</i> with its infantile contents
swung to the front; a heated argument continued
uninterruptedly with shoppers who maintained
that <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">her</i> goods were inferior to those of the
lady squatted cross-legged on her right; another
quick jerk, and the child swung around again to her
back.</p>

<p>So busy were the women that they paid no attention
to the few men&mdash;mostly soldiers&mdash;who strolled
about. If these were the vamps that writers have
proclaimed throughout the ages, one saw no evidence
of the fact in the market. They were the least sex-conscious
women that I have seen anywhere in Latin
America. The Spanish <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señoritas</i> of other parts, no
matter how modest their deportment, were always
supremely aware of the presence of a man. These
Indian girls were intent upon their haggling; in
their rush to sell their goods, they bumped the lounging
men aside as though quite unaware of their existence.
Once in a while, when business lulled, they
glanced up to survey me casually, since I looked out
of place among gaudily-dressed Indians, and I fancied
that they discussed me in Indian dialect. But
they did not appear fascinated. For their flirtation
was limited always to the original remark:</p>

<p>“Buy my cocoanuts, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>!”</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Tehuantepec was hot. One was always thirsty.
The water supply was of doubtful quality. So I
spent most of my time walking home from market
with another armful of cocoanuts.</p>

<p>The saleswomen opened them with one deft chop
from a huge machete, cleaving off the heavy rind,
and leaving just a tiny round hole covered by a thin
peeling of the white coco-meat. When one craved a
drink, one had only to poke a thumb through the thin
white peeling. I consumed cocoanut-milk like a
toper, until my room in the adobe hotel was littered
with the empty shells.</p>

<p>Little Guadalupe, my fourteen-year-old servant-maid,
never removed them. For some reason known
to herself, she would pile them neatly around the
walls of my chamber, where they looked strangely
like the rows of skulls in a catacomb.</p>

<p>Guadalupe was a husky little Indian, rather moon-faced,
and very solemn in the presence of guests.
There were two other maids of her own age who
served us at table, where guests dined with the Spanish
proprietor, and his native wife&mdash;a Tehuana lady
of masculine features and Amazonian proportions.
The maids would enter very seriously and sedately
with their trays of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">frijoles</i>, but once they were out
of sight, we could hear their bare feet scampering
across the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i> as they chased each other to the
kitchen in a game of tag.</p>

<p>Sometimes, as I sat in my mud-walled room, writing
my notes, little Guadalupe would come and hover
about the door, watching me. Then the other two
youngsters would sneak up behind her and push her
inside, shouting:</p>

<p>“Guadalupe likes the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i>!”</p>

<p>Thereupon Guadalupe would exclaim indignantly,
“I do not!” and seizing the first available weapon,
usually the heavy walking stick that lay upon my
table, would chase them over the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i>, all three
looking like tiny plump butterflies as their vividly-colored
garments trailed behind them.</p>

<p>Presently Madame would appear from the region
of the bar, clad also in colors that shamed the rainbow,
her massive bare arms as ponderous as hams,
her Jack Dempsey jaw set in firm lines of disapproval.
Immediately the three little maids would
become as solemn as jurists. Seizing brooms, they
would sweep the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i> with great vim until Madame
withdrew. Then would come the taunt, “Guadalupe
likes the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i>!” and the chase recommenced.</p>

<p>The Spanish proprietor always referred to himself
as the head of the household, but Madame’s
word was law in the establishment. This, in Mexico,
was a domestic situation which never could be found
outside of the Isthmus. Madame sat usually in a
large chair at the bar-room door, from which she
could see whatever transpired in Tehuantepec. Like
the other Tehuana ladies, she carried her weight
with impressive dignity. She was grand and majestic.
Beneath her, the plain little wooden seat
became a royal throne. From it she issued orders
to husband and servants with regal authority, and
even to the passers-by on the street outside.</p>

<p>One day an epileptic threw a fit on the cobbled
roadway. Madame sat there in calm unconcern.
She was not lacking in pity; she was merely waiting
for a pedestrian to pass, in order that she might give
directions for the relief of the unfortunate fit-thrower.
When one did pass, she called out:</p>

<p>“Pick up that fellow and lay him in the sand
where he’ll be more comfortable!”</p>

<p>The pedestrian, a slouching little male person,
jumped with alacrity to obey the command. The
epileptic had just been placed on softer ground and
was throwing his fit in comfort, when the daily circus
parade came around the corner. Its display consisted
of a wheezy band, a horse, a monkey, and one
performer.</p>

<p>“Step over that fellow!” called Madame.</p>

<p>And the parade stepped carefully over the recumbent
figure.</p>

<p>“A very fine woman!” commented the Spanish
proprietor to me in a moment of confidence. “An
asset and an adornment to any hostelry! But there
are times, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>, when she does not comport herself
with the dignity befitting an inn-keeper’s wife. She
feels the call of her Tehuana blood&mdash;the manifestation
of that strange energy which one finds among
these women. Then she slips away from the hotel.
She picks a few cocoanuts, and sneaks down to the
market to sell them! <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Carramba!</i> What idiocy!
But you can not stop her! It is the nature of these
people!”</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>The more I saw of the Tehuana women, the more
I marveled.</p>

<p>Writers had overrated their beauty, but not their
character. Beside them, the girls of Spanish ancestry
appeared doll-like. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señoritas</i> were
pretty, sweet, shy, modest creatures, but devoid of
personality. These Indian maidens had never been
sheltered behind moorish walls; from infancy they
had faced the world, and met their own problems;
they had developed character, and their faces were
clean-cut, with individuality in every feature. The
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señoritas</i>, accustomed to no exercise more violent
then a leisurely stroll in the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>, were frequently
stoop-shouldered and walked with a débutante
slouch. These Indian maidens were as straight as
the shortest distance between two points, and their
step was the lithe, springy step of the athlete.</p>

<p>They were tremendous workers. They would meet
the morning train from Salina Cruz at daybreak;
they would haggle in the market throughout the day;
they would be back at the railway in the evening to
meet the train from the other direction; and thereafter,
until midnight, they would sit outside the circus
tent, still selling their cocoanuts. Despite their
devotion to business, there was always an air of play
about their work. They laughed and chattered in
their Indian dialect. They joshed one another. They
brandished their big machetes in mock anger, and
slapped one another with the flat of the blade, each
slap against a massive buttocks resulting in a loud
“Bam!” that resounded even above the riotous hubbub
of the market-place. But let a stranger appear,
and all fooling ceased. The welkin rang only with
cries of, “Buy my cocoanuts, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>!”</p>

<p>Among such self-sufficient creatures, a man felt
insignificant. These women owned the town. The
shops and most of the houses were feminine property,
as were the big coco-groves surrounding the
city. Men were mere appendages in Tehuantepec&mdash;a
somewhat desirable comfort in a tropical climate&mdash;but
not at all necessary. The soldiers stationed here
looked peculiarly contented, and the older women
all wore strings of twenty-dollar gold pieces as
mementos of the day when the gold-rush to California
led across this Isthmus, yet to the casual observer,
these Indian maidens were the least flirtatious
to be seen in Mexico. If they could find a man&mdash;a
fairly permanent, dependable man, who could be
counted on to remain at home and keep house&mdash;well
and good. They did not bother to vamp the passing
tourist. They were too much interested in bartering.</p>

<p>Their careers as wage-earners and heads of family
had made the older women quite masculine. If they
had lost the grace of the younger maidens, they had
acquired dignity. They strode along the street with
a ponderous aggressiveness, cigars cocked skyward
as among Tammany Hall politicians, arms swinging
massively as though in readiness to floor for the
count any mere male who did not step aside. Many
of these older women were followed by troops of
servants, ready to carry home purchases from the
market. This was a common practice in upper-class
circles elsewhere, for no Latin-American aristocrat
can ever bear to carry home his own purchases, even
if they consist of a single tube of tooth-paste. I was
accustomed to the sight, but it was odd to see an
Indian woman in the gaudy, picturesque costume of
Tehuantepec marching before a retinue of retainers.</p>

<p>Before I realized that these were the local Hetty
Greens, I had the temerity to stop one on the street
with a request that she pose for a photograph. It
was Sunday, and she had supplemented her already-astonishing
regalia with a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">huipile grande</i>&mdash;the old
head-dress of the Isthmus&mdash;an elaborate creation
of white lace that rose from her head like a lion’s
mane and fell to her heels like a peacock’s tail.</p>

<p>“Ten cents!” I said, holding up the coin, in an
appeal which had proved successful in other regions.
“Ten cents if you’ll stop for a picture.”</p>

<p>She gave me one indignant look. Ten cents to one
who owned thirty acres of cocoanut grove, six
houses, and a gin mill! She never paused for a
moment. She came on, full speed ahead, along the
narrow sidewalk, swinging her massive arms. Like
the other mere males in Tehuantepec, I stepped
hastily aside. These Tehuana women might not be
so beautiful as writers had pictured them, but they
undoubtedly were the reigning queens of the Tropics.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Romance was not altogether lacking in Tehuantepec,
even for the casual traveler. As I was about
to depart, the little hotel proprietor stopped me.</p>

<p>“You really should stay longer, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>. In time,
I believe you could win Guadalupe, my little servant.
Young men are scarce here, and she has taken quite
a fancy to you. These girls do not throw themselves
away upon one who flits from flower to flower, as
does the tourist. If you were to wait, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">quien sabe,
señor</i>? She is small, of course, but eventually she
will become a fine big woman, like my own wife.”</p>

<p>But I chose to flit. And one couldn’t take Guadalupe
along. What would a Tehuana lady do if the
traveler were to visit a country that grew no cocoanuts?</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>It was another long day’s journey to the southern
border, through a warm sunny country of
jungle and blue lagoon.</p>

<p>An air of peace and tranquillity pervaded the land.
The engineer, as though infected with the lethargy
of the tropics, loafed along from one tiny village to
another, stopping at every high-peaked hut of thatch
that arose from the low forests of wild cane.</p>

<p>Indians came aboard in merry, chattering groups.
They were clad in brilliant rags, invariably tattered
to shreds, yet blazing with scarlets and greens, and
rivaling the plumage of the parrots and cockatoos
that screamed at us from the bamboo thickets. They
wore narrow-brimmed straw hats, of Guatemalan
type, that seemed diminutive after the immense <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">sombreros</i>
of central Mexico. Each had a hollow rod of
cane slung over the shoulder&mdash;the local style of thermos
bottle. And each was laden with an armful of
infants.</p>

<p>The engineer waited patiently while babies were
loaded and unloaded. Some of the Indians, embarking,
would clamber aboard and receive the children
passed up by friends through the windows. Others,
disembarking, would clamber down and catch the
children tossed to them by friends inside the cars.
The confusion was astounding. Every one jabbered
in a babel of native dialects. But the good humor
of the warm countries always prevailed. Every one
seemed eventually to find the right infant. And we
would loaf onward through the wilderness, among
rolling hills red with coffee berries, past the blue
lagoons where schools of tiny fish leaped in silver
showers, and wild fowl rose in flocks to skim across
the placid waters.</p>

<p>Looking upon the quiet landscape, one would never
have suspected that Mexico was on the eve of another
chronic insurrection.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>This railway was a link in the much-discussed
Pan-American road, which dreamers hope may some
day carry passengers from New York to Buenos
Aires in a week. How soon the vision will ever become
a reality is problematical. The existing links
are few. European merchants, resenting the commercial
advantages it would offer to Americans, are
uniformly opposed to the project. And native governments,
always suspicious of one another, particularly
in Central America, fear its military possibilities.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Nightfall brought us to Tapachula, a pleasant
little city in a rich plantation district.</p>

<p>A diminutive trolley, operated by a Ford engine,
awaited us at the station. The motorman climbed
out to crank it. The passengers crowded aboard. A
host of hotel runners and porters attached themselves
to roof, sides, and platform, until the car itself
was invisible beneath its coating of humanity.</p>

<p>It rattled away upon wobbly tracks through a low-built
plaster city&mdash;a city almost overpowering in its
scent of coffee from the warehouses and drying
floors&mdash;and landed us eventually at one of the most
picturesque <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plazas</i> in Mexico. It fairly blazed with
color. Amid its green were masses of flowering
purple bougainvillea. All about it were red-tiled
roofs. Above it towered a grove of royal palms, tall
and stately, and bursting far aloft into dark olive
plumage, through which the façade of the inevitable
aged cathedral gleamed white against a flaming
tropic sunset.</p>

<p>The streets, bordered by high, narrow sidewalks,
were rudely cobbled, and sloped to a central gutter.
Horsemen with gay ponchos trailing behind them
clattered over the rough stones. Long trains of burros
plodded beneath sacks of coffee, driven by <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peons</i>
in scarlet rags. Tehuana girls, homeward bound
from market, passed in their quaint costume, balancing
earthenware jars above their turbaned
heads.</p>

<p>Before the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">commandancia</i> which faced the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>,
six musicians were playing upon a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">marimba</i>, the
sweet-toned Central-American xylophone, standing
shoulder to shoulder, all tattered and barefoot, playing
so swiftly that their sticks were but streaks of
light, yet playing with perfect rhythm, with beautiful
harmonies, and with a verve that would have delighted
the most blasé jazz-lover on Broadway. The
horsemen paused to listen. The Tehuana girls lingered
at the curb. Army officers in the bright uniforms
of peace-time, were strolling through the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>, flirting with the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señoritas</i>.</p>

<p>Mexico was quiet, and charming, even on the verge
of revolution.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The De la Huerta revolt of 1924 was but a comparatively
small incident in Mexican history.</p>

<p>It will probably be forgotten by the time this book
appears in print. Yet it is fairly typical of such
affairs. And it is rather significant of current political
tendencies which are likely to continue long into
the future.</p>

<p>To understand it, as to understand everything
that happens in Mexico to-day, one must glance into
the past.</p>

<p>This originally was the land of an empire which
combined savagery with civilization. The Aztecs
normally were peaceful tillers of the soil, cultivators
of flowers, and builders of monuments, yet they could
fight courageously upon occasion, and were addicted
to human sacrifices. To this empire came a handful
of Spanish adventurers bent upon conquest. They
were great warriors, these Spaniards, but they conquered
mainly through their cleverness in playing
one group of Indians against another. During the
three centuries of their rule, there was much progress
in Mexico&mdash;as the world of to-day judges
progress, which means the growth of European institutions&mdash;but
the Spaniard held the Indian in subjection
which in many cases became slavery.</p>

<p>Into the soul of the Indian crept a spirit of rebellion.
He rose and cast out the Spaniard. He chose
his own leaders, usually from the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mestizo</i> or mixed-breed
population, only to discover that they were
as ready to exploit him as the Spaniard had been.
Blinded by the eloquent promises of one politician
after another, he marched in every revolution. The
Spaniard had brought to Mexico the political doctrine
that a governor is not the servant but the master
of his people. Whoever gained office promptly
forgot his promises.</p>

<p>To the foreigner, the one bright spot in Mexican
history is the reign of the Dictator, Porfirio Diaz.
He pacified a disorderly country. He built fifteen
thousand miles of railway, established telegraphic
communication throughout the republic, placed Mexico
upon a firm financial basis, and raised it to a
foremost rank among nations. He gave the Indian
prosperity, but failed to educate him; he kept him
in subjection as stern as that of the Spaniard. And
rival politicians, whispering to the Indian that Diaz
had sold his country to the foreign promoter, found
him ready for more revolution.</p>

<p>Then recommenced the old story of one president
after another. In the blood of each was that strain
of the Spanish adventurer who had come to Mexico
to reap a fortune at the expense of the native. The
first to keep his promises to the Indian was Carranza.
Under his new constitution, previously mentioned,
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peon</i> enjoyed so many rights, and the
capitalist so few, that foreigners ceased to invest.</p>

<p>The Indian, theoretically, now owned Mexico.
But he was penniless and ignorant, and he didn’t
know what to do with it. Its riches were the sort
that required money and engineering brains. Its
varied climes would produce any crop grown elsewhere
in the world, but in most regions they required
extensive irrigation. Its rugged mountains possessed
a vast store of mineral wealth&mdash;iron, onyx,
opals, topazes, emeralds, jade, marble, mercury, lead,
zinc, antimony, asphaltum, coal, copper, silver, and
gold&mdash;but they needed machinery and transportation.
Its eastern sands with their fortune in oil had
already made this the third petroleum-producing
country of the world, when only a tenth of the possible
fields had been prospected, but they were of no
value to the untrained Mexican <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peon</i>. He found
himself poorer than ever.</p>

<p>When, in 1920, Obregon raised his revolutionary
standard, the Indian turned against Carranza.
Obregon proved the most capable president since
Diaz. He was adept at compromise. He quickly
pacified the country, hanging the smaller bandits,
and conciliating the larger bandits (like Villa) with
the promise of forgiveness. He pleased the Indian
with agrarian reforms, splitting up the larger estates
into small land-holdings. He brought back the foreign
capitalist with new concessions. Mexico did
not become the heaven which Obregon’s American
propaganda would have had us believe, but it gave
much promise.</p>

<p>Its one dark cloud was a rising tide of Bolshevism.
Obregon, with all his compromise, still
favored the Indian. And the Indian, sensing his new
strength, gloried in it. In Vera Cruz, where the new
movement was strongest, workmen were striking
constantly on trivial excuse or no excuse at all, tenants
had formed a habit of hanging out red flags
as a sign that they were tired of paying rent, and
stevedores were refusing to unload steamers until
the principal port of Mexico was so constantly tied
up as to depress seriously all Mexican business.</p>

<p>The native landholders and property owners&mdash;not
to mention many of the foreign promoters&mdash;were
becoming seriously alarmed at the menace of this
Bolshevism. When it became evident that Obregon
was favoring as his successor at the 1924 elections a
man who favored the Indian even more stoutly than
he himself&mdash;General Calles&mdash;the moneyed interests
promptly started a new revolution headed by Adolfo
de la Huerta. The significant point about this revolution
is that the Indian&mdash;or a part of the Indian
population&mdash;promptly rose to follow the De la
Huerta standard, deserting his own shibboleths to
die for principles which throughout all earlier Mexican
history he had striven to overthrow.</p>

<p>Among the fifteen million people of Mexico, only
one million are of pure white ancestry. Six million
are full-blooded Indians. Among the other eight
million <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mestizos</i> aboriginal strains predominate.
With employment and fair treatment the natives
are peaceable. But like their Aztec ancestors they
are potential fighters. When discontent awakens
the old spirit of rebellion first aroused by the Spaniard,
they rise blindly to follow some new leader,
believing that at last they have discovered a friend,
when they have merely discovered another self-seeking
politician bent upon their exploitation. When
they do find a friend, they are too ignorant to appreciate
the fact. They are the ready dupes of ambitious
generals.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>In Tapachula, the insurrection was marked principally
by much blowing of bugles on the part of the
Obregon garrison.</p>

<p>The civilian population remained unperturbed.</p>

<p>The soldiery hailed the affair as another good excuse
for drinking. Possibly their officers had paid
them as a first step toward insuring their loyalty
in the campaign to follow. They promptly filled the
local bar-rooms, and swaggered about the streets
with the air of increased importance which comes to
a military man in time of war.</p>

<p>As always in Mexico, the martial spirit brought to
the surface the anti-foreign sentiment. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peon</i>,
whatever his opinion of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringos</i>, is usually polite,
but inspired by thoughts of battle&mdash;and a few swigs
of rum&mdash;he occasionally tells the foreigner what he
thinks of him. A fat sergeant, careening wildly by
on a little burro, so drunk that he threatened at
every lurch to overturn his diminutive mount, reviled
my ancestry as he galloped past. A group of
soldiers, making merry in a saloon near the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>,
set down their bottle of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mescal</i> to damn all Americans.
One of them staggered out with the evident
intention of picking a quarrel, but his attention was
distracted at the sight of a Tehuana girl lingering
at the curb. Seizing her arm, he grinned in an effort
at blandishment. She broke loose with an angry,
“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Vaya!</i> Run along! <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Andale!</i>” and hurried down
the street, while a policeman on the corner chuckled
and twirled his own moustachios. The soldier
turned to me again, muttering something about tearing
a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo’s</i> heart from the breast. He started
toward me, wavered unsteadily, collided with a
house-wall and collapsed in the gutter.</p>

<p>For a day the soldiery swaggered all over town,
but the next morning their generals&mdash;now in business-like
khaki&mdash;rounded them up and marched them
to the railway station, where all passenger traffic
had ceased and all cars had been commandeered for
transport.</p>

<p>They passed beneath my hotel balcony&mdash;a motley
crew of evil-visaged little fellows, with cartridges
glistening from many bandoleers&mdash;cheering and
singing. Behind them came a nondescript mob of
slatternly women, old and young and middle-aged&mdash;the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">soldaderas</i>, or camp-followers, who transport the
baggage, cook the food, perform whatever other
services a soldier may require, and sometimes assist
in the actual fighting, occasionally with a rifle, but
usually with sticks or stones, wherewith they engage
in combat the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">soldaderas</i> of the enemy. Barefoot,
bedraggled, unwashed, they were bent under loads
of fruit-baskets, blankets, saddle-bags, water-jars,
and even live chickens.</p>

<p>A few of the marchers glanced up at my balcony
to hurl a last curse at the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i>. Then they vanished
around the corner, bound northward to the
scene of battle. Tapachula resumed its atmosphere
of peace, quite as though Mexico were untroubled by
one of its chronic insurrections.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>One must not assume that a Mexican revolution is
a comic opera affair. The least conspicuous uprising
sows something of death, destruction, and a
loss of feminine virtue in its wake. But Mexico is
large and sparsely populated, and can stage a dozen
revolutions at once without disturbance of its general
calm.</p>

<p>The De la Huerta revolt raged principally in
central Mexico. For a few months the republic was
aflame from Vera Cruz to Manzanillo. But Obregon
had the best generals. The United States, taking the
quickest means to bring about order, allowed him to
buy arms denied the revolutionists. The Huertistas,
beaten and dispersed, fled southward into the jungles
of Tehuantepec, fighting sporadically along the railway
I had just traversed, until completely disbanded.
American newspaper readers settled back in
their easy chairs with the self-congratulatory comment,
“There’s another revolution over! Those
Mexicans must be a cut-throat lot!”</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>When one travels through Mexico one is amazed
to discover that the Mexicans do not appear a cut-throat
lot.</p>

<p>The great masses of Indian and semi-Indian population
appear quiet, simple, peaceable folk. Now
and then, after the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tequila</i> has flowed freely, some
of them may beat their wives or cut their neighbors’
throats, but this is not their regular pastime. In
fact, most Old-Timers in the country deny that crime
is any more frequent there than at home.</p>

<p>Why then, the traveler always asks himself, can
these people not elect a president without bloodshed?</p>

<p>One finds the answer by observing their politeness.</p>

<p>This politeness is extremely personal. The man
who talked for half an hour to the ticket agent,
keeping forty other persons waiting while he asked
after all the members of the other man’s family, is
a case in point. So are the two acquaintances&mdash;familiar
to every one who has lived in Mexico&mdash;who
meet upon a narrow sidewalk, embrace demonstratively,
and stand there for another half hour, enjoying
one another’s professions of love and admiration
to such an extent that they force all other
pedestrians to step out into the gutter.</p>

<p>It is a personal politeness which must be rigidly
observed, no matter how much inconvenience it may
cause the general public. One finds it everywhere
in Mexican life&mdash;and this discussion might be extended
to apply to the life of the neighboring countries
given to revolution. It permeates business,
where salesmanship follows the methods&mdash;now comparatively
obsolete at home&mdash;of concentrating upon
favorably impressing the buyer rather than demonstrating
the superior merits of one’s goods. And
when applied to politics, it becomes the good old
principle of “What’s the constitution among
friends?”</p>

<p>Mexican loyalty is an extremely personal loyalty.
The Mexican may love his home, and the immediate
land upon which he resides, but he has no conception
of patriotism. He uses the phrase for oratorical
purposes, but the idea is vague. He would rally
to his country’s flag to fight a foreign invader, but
beyond that, he has no devotion to his republic, or
to the ideals and principles&mdash;whatever they may be&mdash;for
which Mexico stands. He knows only loyalty
to certain leaders. His political parties do not go
by the name of Liberal or Conservative, Republican
or Democrat, but by the name of the candidate. The
Mexican is always an <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Obregonista</i>, or a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Villista</i> or a
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Carranzista</i> or a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Huertista</i>.</p>

<p>Once in office, the successful politician practices
the spoils system, which is not unknown in our own
republic, but which reaches a far higher point of efficiency
in Mexico. Into office come all his personal
friends. They have spent their money to elect him.
Now they must reimburse themselves. Graft, fairly
common in other lands, is an art in these countries.
Scarcely a sum of money ever changes hands in the
course of government operations without shrinking
at least slightly. Political office is the quick, sure
road to financial success. No one knows how soon
a term may end, wherefore every one makes hay
while the sun shines, for to-morrow it may rain
bullets. Should one administration reach the end
of its term&mdash;and Mexico’s latest constitution limits
a president to one term&mdash;the old principle of personal
courtesy to a friend continues. The retiring
president names his own successor, whose election&mdash;since
his troops control the polls&mdash;he can definitely
guarantee.</p>

<p>The Mexican believes in this loyalty to friends.
He expects the successful politician to give all the
plums to his supporters, regardless of their abilities
for the several posts. Not placing a high value upon
honesty, except verbally, he takes it for granted that
most of them will rob the people. He understands
that they are loath to relinquish office. And in his
heart, he would condemn the president as disloyal
if he did not stuff the ballot boxes in favor of a
chosen successor. His indignation is not aroused at
such proceedings. He would do the same things
himself if he were in power. But if he happens to be
a rival politician, without power, and with no prospect
of gaining it except by forcibly dislodging the
other fellow, he affects great indignation. He whispers
to the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peon</i> his horror at the prevailing misgovernment.
“These villains,” he says, “are robbing
you!” And he rises in arms, followed by the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peon</i>, to save Mexico from its unpatriotic despoilers.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, it is only a comparatively
small part of the population that follows. The great
bulk of the Mexican people <em>are</em> peaceable; they are
tired of revolution; they have lost faith in new
leaders; they prefer to remain neutral, and to cheer
diplomatically for whoever proves the victor. The
revolutionary army is recruited like the federal
army from the unemployed, from those who have
tired of working and hope to obtain political office
themselves, from young boys who are thrilled by
the prospect of carrying a gun, and from a certain
lawless element that welcomes the possibility of loot
and rape.</p>

<p>Should the revolution prove abortive, the Government
generals quickly suppress it. A few of its
leaders are hanged, a few soldiers executed; the
rest of the rebels slip away quietly, hide their weapons,
and return innocently to their work. Should
the revolution prove successful, the Government
generals forget their loyalty to the President; they
jump quickly to the other side, taking with them
their ignorant troops&mdash;who are never quite sure
whom they are fighting, anyway&mdash;and fight valiantly,
as always, to save Mexico. The President flees.
The revolutionists hold a banquet at the Palace,
where they make flowery speeches about their patriotism.
They conduct an election, make one of
their number president, and accept his appointments
to office. And there they remain, until another revolution
throws them out, or until a squabble starts
among themselves as to which shall next succeed to
the presidency.</p>

<p>The American reading public always condemns
the revolutionist. It can not seem to grasp the fact
that elections are never honest in Mexico; that
whoever controls the polls is the man elected; that
Mexico has never had a constitutional president who
did not first capture the Palace by force of arms;
that revolution consequently is the only course
whereby there can be a change of parties. Usually
the revolution is justifiable. But invariably it
brings to office another man who, like the man at the
ticket window, is more considerate of his personal
friends than of the general public.</p>

<p>The Mexicans are not a cut-throat lot. They are
merely too courteous.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Yet Mexico always weathers her storms.</p>

<p>Even in revolution, unless one chances to be caught
at the particular scene of the disturbance, this land
is supremely tranquil.</p>

<p>In Tapachula the only evidence of the turmoil was
an ever-lengthening line of brown-faced prisoners
sitting crossed-legged on the street before the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">commandancia</i>,
picking with their machetes at the rank
weeds that grew up among the cobblestones.</p>

<p>As in Hermosillo a moon smiled down over the
low flat roofs. The lilting song of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">marimba</i>
echoed hauntingly through the dim streets. And the
plaintive notes of a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gendarme’s</i> whistle assured the
world that all was well.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>From Tapachula to the Guatemalan border,
there was a train every two or three days,
provided traffic warranted so much service.</p>

<p>It took me through a bamboo forest, and dropped
me at Suchiate, a straggling village of thatched
huts beside a muddy river, where I had my first
experience with the formalities attendant upon the
crossing of a Central-American frontier.</p>

<p>First one had to secure permission from the Mexican
authorities to leave their country. In a whitewashed
shed three leisurely gentlemen in their shirt
sleeves were viséing passports. Before they would
proceed, one had to obtain stamps, procurable only
at another shack, located as always in these countries
at the opposite end of town, and reached by
trudging through deep sand beneath a broiling sun.
And when, after half an hour or more, one returned
with the stamps, there were questions:</p>

<p>Why were we leaving Mexico? When? Where
were we going? Why? What had we done in Mexico?
Why the devil had we come there, anyhow?
What was our profession? Married or single? How
many children? Why? Where were they? And
how?</p>

<p>And when one had convinced the officials of his
respectability, there was another long hike across
an endless sunny grass-plain, to a palm-thatched
shelter at the river bank, where other officials ransacked
the baggage. A boatman poled the few emigrants
across the swirling waters to Guatemala.
And the entire proceeding recommenced on the other
side.</p>

<p>The Guatemalan officials had no office. They stood
in the shade of a pepper tree, flanked on one side by
a squad of barefooted soldiers, on the other by an
ox-cart, and backed by the town’s juvenile population.
They pretended very solemnly to read every
word in the passports&mdash;although one traveler’s was
in Russian and another’s in Syrian. They paused
now and then to shake their heads doubtfully and exchange
suspicious glances. But at length, when
every one had proved his solvency by displaying
thirty-five dollars in American currency&mdash;Guatemalan
bills not being considered sufficient proof of
solvency&mdash;they passed us all. Baggage was loaded
upon the ox-cart, and we started for the custom-house,
led by the soldiers, and followed by the
juvenile population.</p>

<p>There was another wait of more than an hour
while the custom inspector finished his lunch, took
his <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">siesta</i>, and smoked his cigarette. At last, however,
he made his appearance, scribbled in chalk
all over the outside of trunks and suit-cases, filled
out several printed reports, and collected from each
of us ten Guatemalan dollars&mdash;or fourteen cents in
American money&mdash;and the formalities were concluded.</p>

<p>We were officially admitted to the Republic of
Guatemala.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>From Ayutla, the Guatemalan frontier station, to
Guatemala City was another day’s ride.</p>

<p>The railway coaches, if possible, were just a trifle
more dilapidated than those of Mexico, but the train
made better time. The way led through a continuation
of the bamboo forests, but it soon rose to the
cooler highlands, where volcanic cones towered into
the clouds. One or two of the craters were smoking,
filling the sky with dense masses of white vapor, and
sprinkling the earth with a fine lava dust.</p>

<p>To all Central America, these volcanoes are blessings.
Occasionally the attendant earthquakes may
shake down a city, but the lava dust enriches the soil,
and a good coffee crop provides the wherewithal for
reconstruction. The Pacific slopes of Guatemala
are exceedingly fertile. Coming from Mexico,
where revolution had brought a cessation of work,
one noticed the air of prosperity in this little Central
American country. The hills everywhere were red
with coffee berries, the plantations were neatly kept,
and the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peons</i> all seemed busy.</p>

<p class="center">THE ABUNDANT CENTRAL-AMERICAN VOLCANOES FERTILIZE THE COFFEE
FINCAS WITH LAVA DUST<br /></p>

<p>They were very small, these Guatemalan Indians,
<span id="small">so small that they suggested</span> Lilliputians, but remarkably
sturdy. They appeared to earn their living
principally by carrying bundles. Every woman on
the road was galloping along with swift, flat-footed
stride, swinging her arms as though paddling her
way, balancing on her head a basket of produce or a
great cluster of earthenware jars. Every man had
a load upon his back, sometimes so much larger than
himself that he resembled a tiny ant struggling beneath
a huge beetle. He supported his burden with
straps over his shoulders, and with a band about his
forehead, so that by inclining his neck forward or
back, he could shift the weight. These people
showed no bulging muscle; theirs was the smooth
modeling of the Indian physique that concealed tremendous
strength. They seemed never to pause for
rest, but trotted untiringly, serving as pack-animals
in the more remote regions for fourteen cents a day,
and carrying a hundred and fifty pounds for twelve
hours or more.</p>

<p>They were the most colorful types to be seen south
of Tehuantepec. Each village had its own distinctive
costume, particularly among the women. At
one station they were wearing short purple jackets
that disclosed six inches of bronze stomach. At
another they were clad in tight blue skirts, a waist
of print cloth, and a wide sash of blazing scarlet
wrapped tightly about the hips. At another they
were draped in <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">serapes</i> with a design picturing such
confusion as might occur if a bolt of lightning were
to become entangled in a rainbow.</p>

<p>Guatemala is essentially an Indian republic.
Among its 2,250,000 people&mdash;who incidentally comprise
forty per cent. of the total population of Central
America&mdash;there are a million of pure aboriginal
ancestry. The whites are comparatively scarce.
Yet this is the least democratic of the local nations,
and the whites dominate it completely. The greater
part of the country belongs to a few wealthy landlords,
either native or German, and the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peon</i>,
although not mistreated, has little to say about his
government. But the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peon</i> always has employment.
And Guatemala is prosperous.</p>

<p>One noticed that the train did not stop long for
Indians who wished to board it, as did trains in
Mexico. If a wealthy <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">hacendado</i> were seen advancing
down the road, the conductor waited for him. If
two dozen barefoot passengers were at the station,
the engineer tooted his whistle peremptorily, paused
only for a moment, allowed them to scramble aboard
as best they could, and was off again.</p>

<p>After Mexico, this speed was startling. Considering
the size of Central-American republics, one
feared lest the train overrun the boundary lines and
trespass upon the sovereignty of Salvator or Honduras.
But it stayed within its own domain, turning
eastward, and climbing out of the coffee-covered
Pacific slopes to the pine-clad heights of central
Guatemala, landing us in the evening at Guatemala
City, 4870 feet above the sea.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>To the American at home, all Central America is
a heat-stricken jungle. He invariably greets the returned
traveler with, “I’ll bet you’re glad to get
back to God’s country!” As a matter of fact, Guatemala
City&mdash;like Tegucigalpa, in Honduras, and San
José in Costa Rica, and some several other cities in
all these countries&mdash;has a climate which no city in
the United States can equal. It is pleasantly warm
at mid-day, and delightfully cool at night. The
traveler in these parts always pities the American
at home, who freezes for six months, and sweats
for six months. He never can understand why the
poor fellow doesn’t let the farm go to seed, and
move down to a decent climate.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The Guatemalan capital is a pleasant city, but
not handsome.</p>

<p>Built low and massively, it gives one the impression
that it is patiently awaiting another earthquake.
In its past it has been moved about from
time to time in the hope that it might find a resting
place free from nature’s assaults, but another tremor
always finds it and shakes it to pieces. It was destroyed
in 1917 and again in 1918. A writer never
dares use the phrase, “The last earthquake,” since
another is apt to occur before his book reaches print.</p>

<p>At the time of my visit, in 1924, its builders had
apparently become discouraged. Many of the buildings
were still but a heap of crumbled ruins. The
streets were rough, paved with cobbles partially dislodged,
and marked with crazy trails which traffic
had worn out in years of zigzagging from curb to
curb in an effort to find passage. The drivers of the
little old cabs worked their way along these streets
like sailors tacking through a tortuous channel, and
only large automobiles were in evidence, for the
smaller variety so popular in Mexico would have
shaken passengers to death.</p>

<p>At the main <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>, the Cathedral was surrounded
by piles of débris. Since Guatemala keeps the
church in the same restraint as does Mexico, the
Bishop could not afford to rebuild every year or
two. The edifice now stood with columns seamed
and cracked, with dome and towers completely gone,
and with its greenish silver bells protected by improvised
board shelters. The interior also presented
a patched effect, and a ruined altar was replaced by
a less ornate substitute, but business was proceeding
as usual.</p>

</span></p>
<p class="center">OCCASIONALLY THE RESULTANT EARTHQUAKES KNOCK DOWN A CITY
OR DESTROY THE GUATEMALAN CATHEDRAL<br /></p>

<p>Guatemala, however, is the largest city in Central
America. Its population&mdash;estimated as accurately
as anything is estimated in these parts&mdash;numbers
something between a hundred and two hundred
thousand. If a trifle crumbled, it is the most complete
city hereabouts. There are many shops, several
banks, a number of theaters, and a host of excellent
hotels. There is local color in abundance, for
Indians in picturesque garb walk the streets, lounge
in the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>, and congregate in the native market behind
the cathedral, quite as primitive as in the rural
districts. There is electric light, a system of mail
boxes set into the house-walls at every corner, and
even a café with an orchestra at every half block for
those who crave modernity.</p>

<p>These cafés are really a distinguishing feature of
Guatemala City. Elsewhere in Central America
waitresses are usually waiters. Here the waiters
are usually waitresses&mdash;rather coquettish little
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señoritas</i>, whose smiles are served gratis with every
order. The coffee-kings gather there nightly to keep
their wealth in circulation, and to bask in the smiles.
They drink somewhat immoderately, as in Mexico,
and wait patiently to the closing hour, only to learn
that the girls’ own parents call to take them straight
home. But the coffee-kings are ever hopeful. They
come back night after night. And the cafés possess
a gayety that adds to the city’s attractiveness.</p>

<p>Neither revolution, nor earthquake, nor disappointment
in love can dampen the good humor of
these countries.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>By chance, on my first evening in Guatemala City,
I was held up by a highwayman.</p>

<p>I was rambling about unaccustomed streets, when
a polite little brown gentleman stepped out of a
doorway, poked a revolver into my ribs, and said
courteously:</p>

<p>“Pardon, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>. Please to raise both the hands
above the head, and to tell me in which pocket I shall
find your watch and your money.”</p>

<p>My watch was one of those cheap things which the
traveler always carries for such an emergency. My
money formed a large wad, but it was all in Guatemalan
currency, and I had my doubts as to whether
my assailant would accept it. Back in Tapachula the
Guatemalan Consul, having viséd my passport, had
refused the moth-eaten bills of his own country, demanding
American greenbacks, but finally compromising
upon Mexican gold. The highwayman,
however, was too polite to refuse.</p>

<p>“I thank you greatly, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>,” he said. “Again I
beg your pardon, and bid you <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">adios</i>.”</p>

<p>Covering me with the revolver, he backed around
a corner. When I looked to see where he had gone,
he was running furiously down the dark street. He
had taken a hundred and fourteen Guatemalan dollars,
or about ninety cents in American coinage.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>In any Central-American republic, one notices a
“homey” quality lacking in the larger territory of
Mexico.</p>

<p>In these smaller nations, every one of any prominence
knows every one else. The capital is something
of a Latinized Main Street. This is more true of the
little countries to the south, but Guatemala is not
completely an exception. Its provincialism manifests
itself particularly in the newspaper, which
savors always of the local country weekly, although
a flowery verbosity gives it a unique distinction.</p>

<p>In Mexico City, one finds a press quite the equal of
the American, with a several-page daily edition that
shows an appreciation of news values, and a Sunday
edition complete even to rotogravure picture section
and comic supplement. In Guatemala City one finds
a little four-page sheet, published apparently by
some gentleman who desires an organ for the glorification
of his friends and the vilification of his enemies.</p>

<p>On its first page is the feature story of a party
given last night by the editor’s brother-in-law, Don
Guilliermo Pan y Queso Escobar, whose palatial
mansion was graced by a felicitous gathering of our
most illustrious men and our most charming women,
truly representative of the very cream of our distinguished
society, and so on with an ever-swelling
multitude of flattering adjectives. Beside it is an
account of the Commencement Exercises of the local
stenographic college&mdash;of which the editor’s uncle is
the principal&mdash;an event which seems to have been
a complete success, for it was celebrated with an
éclat both artistic and educational unsurpassed in
the history of our city, and every number of the
delightful and uplifting program was greeted by
rapturous applause, the audience sitting spellbound
as the estimable, virtuous, and pulchritudinous
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señoritas</i> of the student body demonstrated their efficiency
by taking down in shorthand, almost word for
word, the speech of the director, our sympathetic and
greatly admired fellow-countryman, Don Ricardo
Cantando y Bailando Chavez, to whom great credit
is due for the distinction and finesse with which the
entire entertainment, and thus and thus, until the
article closes with a list of the persons present, the
illustrious and distinguished everybody in the audience
who wore shoes.</p>

<p>On the last inside page, hidden among the advertisements,
are the brief cablegrams from the rest of
the world, announcing the death of Lenine, the invasion
by France of the German Ruhr, and such other
unimportant events as the destruction of Tokio by
earthquake, the election of a new American president,
or a war in Europe.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Guatemala contained a large colony of foreigners.
There were many Germans engaged in the coffee
business on the Pacific slopes, many Americans from
the banana plantations of the Caribbean Coast, a
few exiled European noblemen who had come with
the remnants of their former fortunes to live as long
as possible without working in a country where living
was cheap, and several Old-Timers, all with the
rank of General, who had fought in the various past
revolutions of Central America, and were now resting
upon their laurels.</p>

<p>These countries have long been the happy hunting
ground of the soldier of fortune, of whom the greatest
since William Walker was General Lee Christmas,
who died at New Orleans while I was at the
scene of his exploits.</p>

<p>Christmas came to Central America as a locomotive
engineer. It had been his profession in Mississippi
until a wreck, followed by an investigation,
brought out the fact that he was color-blind and
could not distinguish signals. Central America was
less strict about such things in those days. In fact,
most of the old-time engineers are said to have
driven their trains with a whiskey-flask handy, and
with few worries about such things as signals.
Christmas found employment, but he became accidentally
entangled in an insurrection, and formed
the habit. On one occasion, when he was driving an
engine in Guatemala, he is said to have received
news of an outbreak in Honduras, and to have left
his train with all its freight and passengers standing
on the track while he hopped out of the cab-window
and hiked overland through the jungles to
join the fray. His greatest exploit was that of
repulsing an entire army with a machine-gun,
assisted only by one other <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i>, a Colonel Guy
Maloney, now Superintendent of Police in New Orleans.
He drifted from one country to another,
wherever a fight seemed most promising, followed
by troops that varied in number from two men to
fourteen thousand.</p>

<p>“He was a good scout, too,” agreed most of the
Old-Timers in Guatemala City. “He’d give you his
last cent, if you needed it. He’d have been a millionaire,
if he’d saved half the money he got from the
governments he helped, but he blew it all in on parties.
He’d get drunk with you, or he’d go down the
line with you, or he’d fight you&mdash;anything to please
his friends. He was pretty square, usually, when he
held office. When he was Chief of Police up in Tegucigalpa,
if his best pals raised the devil, he’d stick
them right in jail. And when their term was over,
he’d give them a whale of a good party.”</p>

<p>His revolutionary habits finally became so annoying
to Washington that his citizenship was canceled.
Broken-hearted about it, he came home, assisted the
secret service throughout the European War, and
was reinstated. When he fell ill from old wounds
and fevers contracted in Central-American jungles,
many Old-Timers cabled offers of assistance, and his
old lieutenant, Colonel Guy Maloney, gave him a
blood transfusion, but it was too late. When the
news of his death reached Central America, more
than one president probably heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>Guatemala City was filled with other ex-adventurers,
all a little jealous of Christmas’ fame, and
all inclined to belittle one another. They sat about
the hotel lobbies, spinning yarns about “that little
affair down in Nicaragua,” or “that little scrap up
in Honduras,” and if I mentioned to one the story of
some other, he would snort loudly with derision.</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe it! He’s a damned wind-bag!
Next time he mentions getting that sword stuck
through his lung, you just ask him if he remembers
the mule that got him up against the corral wall and
kicked hell out of him!”</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Guatemala has had its revolutions from time to
time, yet its history&mdash;as compared with that of its
immediate neighbors&mdash;has been fairly peaceful.</p>

<p>If it has not had a succession of <em>good</em> rulers, it
has at least had a succession of <em>strong</em> rulers. Its
Indians are a docile race, a race much more easily
conquered by the Spaniards than were the Indians
of Mexico, and much more easily dominated by the
white landlords of to-day. And the army, if not
impressive when on dress parade, is one of the most
dependable armies in Central America.</p>

<p>In recruiting its soldiers, the government resorts
to the selective draft. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Jefe Politico</i>&mdash;the all-powerful
local official&mdash;visits each coffee planter,
and secures a list of the pickers who have picked the
least coffee during the past year. These, provided
his soldiers can catch them, are enlisted in the army.
Once enrolled, the little <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peons</i> are equipped with
uniform, not very elaborately or neatly, but sufficiently
to distinguish them from civilians. In the
Capital, they are also equipped with shoes, not for
efficiency but for the sake of appearances. Unaccustomed
to footwear, they have to be trained to its use,
and nothing is more amusing than the sight of a
new battalion thus shod and stumbling awkwardly
over the rough streets. They look uncomfortable
and self-conscious, and at each halt will pick up
their feet and glare at the shoes much as milady’s
poodle glares at a pink ribbon tied around its tail.</p>

<p>Yet these little Indians, stupid and illiterate, make
better soldiers than the more intelligent <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mestizos</i>,
or mixed-bloods. They are more susceptible to discipline.
In most of these countries, virtue goes with
ignorance, to such an extent that the mixed-bloods
are called <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ladinos</i> in Guatemala&mdash;a word that
originally meant “tricksters.” The little Indians
are far more loyal to the president in office than are
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mestizo</i> soldiers of the neighboring republics,
and are less apt to desert the existing government
when an insurrection threatens.</p>

<p>Guatemala’s several Dictators, also, have been
artists at the business of discouraging opposition.</p>

<p>Of them all, Estrada Cabrera stands out head and
shoulders above other despots not only of Guatemala
but of all Latin America. Until a very few
years ago he reigned for term after term, proclaiming
himself re-elected when necessary, and quietly
murdering any politician who gave the slightest indication
of opposing him.</p>

<p>Why he clung to the presidency is a mystery. He
was so fearful of assassination that he scarcely ever
showed himself outside the palace. He slept usually
in a house across the street, reached by a secret
passageway. He ate nothing except what his own
mother prepared for him. He would have a dozen
beds made up each night, and only one or two of his
most trusted guardians knew which one he occupied.
He seriously handicapped the country’s mining interests
by placing a ban on the importation of blasting
powder, lest it be used to blow him up. On the
one occasion when he attended a public ceremony,
a bomb killed his carriage-driver and the horses,
barely missing the Dictator himself. Since it was
exploded by an electrical device, he thereafter placed
a ban on all electric contrivances, and visitors to the
country were relieved even of such things as pocket
flashlights.</p>

<p>But from his isolation within the palace, he manipulated
all the strings of government, and all Guatemala
felt his power. He personally blue-penciled
every foreign news dispatch that left the country,
and sometimes even the personal cablegrams. He
maintained an elaborate spy system, with one agent
watching another agent, until every man in the republic
was under survey. He permitted no public
gatherings where people might discuss politics. He
forbade the organization of any kind of society, and
once suppressed a chess club.</p>

<p>Quite possibly, he believed that these measures
were justified. It is affirmed by many that Guatemala
made more progress under his rule than at any
period of brief presidencies. Certainly he did not
follow the course of enriching himself sufficiently in
one term to spend the rest of his life in Paris&mdash;a
course extremely popular among Central-American
executives. And many an Old-Timer will say, “The
old devil was never so bad as they pictured him.”</p>

<p>But those who opposed his will used to die quite
silently and suddenly, and his enemies affirm that
Cabrera used poison. One hears strange stories
about his political methods:</p>

<p>He is said on one occasion to have decreed the
death of an American who had incurred his enmity.
To avoid international complications he dispatched
a second American to do the dirty work. The second
American went to the first, warned him, and
advised him to leave the country. Then he returned
to inform Cabrera that the other man had escaped.
He did not know that a native spy, having followed
him, had already reported the meeting. Cabrera
smiled. “That is too bad! But you could not help
it, so have a cocktail with me, and forget all about
it.” Three hours later, the American did forget all
about it. He dropped dead.</p>

<p>One hesitates to believe all the stories, for Old-Timers
love to shock the itinerant journalist. But
certain it is that he kept all Guatemala in terror of
his authority, until many of the more ignorant believed
him gifted with supernatural powers.</p>

<p>In his later days, as in the history of most despots,
he lost his grip upon the country. He had made too
many enemies. Every one hated him, yet hesitated
through fear of spies to be the first to proclaim
opposition. But the inevitable revolution finally
materialized, and Cabrera fled the capital. He
surrendered on condition that his life and property
be respected. It is to the credit of the Guatemalans
that they observed their agreement, although
lynch-law might have been more justifiable.</p>

<p>One Carlos Herrera, a wealthy landlord, took his
place, but he did not relish the job as did Cabrera.
After a few months, when some one else started a
revolution, he made no objection. It was comparatively
bloodless. A few policemen were the only
casualties. They had not been informed that a revolution
was scheduled, and when they saw the mobs
surging up the street, undertook to quell what they
considered a disorderly scene. One completely organized
government went out overnight, and another
completely organized government came in. Shooting
was by way of celebration. An American who
had an engagement with Herrera the next day went
to the palace, and inquired, “Is Herrera in?” and
received the answer, “Herrera’s out; Orellana’s
in.” Only one man was arrested. He landed in
Puerto Barrios, the north coast port, with a cheerful
jag, and cabled Herrera, “On arriving in your beautiful
country, I hasten to salute you and to wish you
a long life and a merry one.” The new government
arrested him for treason, but released him as soon
as he proved his ignorance that a revolution had
transpired.</p>

<p>Orellana, who held office at the time of my visit,
was a former lieutenant of Cabrera’s. He had occupied
the seat beside Cabrera when the bomb blew up
coachman and horses. There were rumors afloat
that Cabrera’s brain still directed the government,
but they received little credence. Another story,
purely humorous, was that on the night when Orellana
overthrew Herrera, the ex-Dictator started to
pile all his furniture against the door of his room.</p>

<p>“But, sir,” protested a servant, “these are your
own friends coming back into power.”</p>

<p>“That’s why I’m doing this,” said Cabrera. “I
know those fellows!”</p>

<p>Cabrera’s house was a fortress-like structure of
unassuming exterior. An old man now, he was
still following his life-long policy of retirement from
the public gaze, and a guard of soldiers was present
to see that he remained in retirement. The family
came and went freely, but the ex-Dictator never
showed his face. If he had done so, some one might
have taken a shot at it. He probably welcomed the
guard for its protection.</p>

<p>Orellana, despite his former connection with Cabrera,
was proving a more lenient president. Clubs
were now thriving, and the people might congregate
where they pleased. Poison had been abolished as
a function of government. And men might discuss
politics without being shot. Few, however,
publicly suggested a change of president. With all
its comparative liberality, the new régime was ruling
with an iron hand characteristic of Guatemalan
governments. Shortly before my visit, Orellana had
chased home a party of Mexican bolshevik agitators
attempting to spread their propaganda among the
Indians of his republic. A few years earlier, when
his railway employees threatened a strike unless
permitted to select their own officials and to discharge
all foreigners from the service, the American
superintendent had told them to go to Hades, and
Orellana had sent them back to work by threatening
to draft them all into the army.</p>

<p>These countries always thrive best under a stern
dictator. Even under the tyrannical Cabrera,
Guatemala enjoyed more prosperity than it would
have enjoyed under a rapidly-changing series of get-rich-quick
presidents. For a land of illiterate <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peons</i>,
a dictatorship, if exercised with justice, is always
the most satisfactory form of government, except to
politicians out of office.</p>

<p>The two principal products of Central America
are coffee and bananas. The Central-American remains
in the cool highlands of the Pacific coast, and
raises the coffee. To the invading foreigner he
cedes the lowlands of the Caribbean for the culture
of the bananas.</p>

<p>In Guatemala, it was a day’s railway journey
from coffee country to banana country&mdash;first
through a stretch of magnificent scenery, <span id="forest">of forested
mountains</span>, and of rugged gorges spanned by
several of the world’s highest railway bridges&mdash;then
through a tedious expanse of desert, where the
woodland gave way to scraggly cactus, and the
mountains (although still majestic and piled one
atop another until they reached the clouds) were
swept by a fitful wind that blew gustily, transferring
the sand from the landscape to the eye&mdash;and finally
down among the swampy, jungle-grown lowlands of
the coastal plains, into the empire of the United
Fruit Company.</p>

<p>The stucco dwellings of moorish design gradually
gave way to wooden shanties, and Guatemalan natives
to West Indian blacks. Years ago, before sanitary
engineering made the tropics liveable, the inhabitants
of this region had retired to the cooler
highlands, where snakes and fever were less abundant.
To-day the greater part of the East Coast, all
the way from Guatemala to Panama, is in the hands
of the United Fruit Company or its several minor
competitors. Except in Guatemala or Costa Rica,
which have rail connection from ocean to ocean,
banana-land is closer to New Orleans than to the
capital of its own country. It is peopled with a few
American or English bosses, and a host of imported
negroes. Its prevailing language is English. And
it bears more resemblance to Africa than to the
Central America of which it is a part.</p>

<p>A young English superintendent met me at Quiriguá,
one of the United Fruit Company’s plantations,
and conducted me to a cottage with screened verandas,
where one might have fancied himself in the
Americanized Canal Zone. The camp was neatly
laid out, with well-trimmed grass-plots and cement
walks lined by rows of yellow croton and red hibiscus
and shaded by coco-palms or breadfruit trees.
Each superintendent had his own cottage; there was
a large hotel for the lesser <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i> employees; the
local hospital was the largest and best-appointed in
Central America; everywhere one observed that
orderliness and modernity wherewith the Anglo-Saxon
is constantly abolishing the local color of all
foreign lands.</p>

<p>On all sides of the camp the banana groves extended
as far as the eye could follow them, like a
rank uncut lawn of brilliant green. Narrow-gage
tracks wandered out in all directions through the
lanes of trees, and many <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i> bosses&mdash;all clean-cut
young fellows, neatly dressed in khaki, who did
their bit to destroy the fictional romance of the tropics
by shaving each morning and donning a white
collar&mdash;were spinning along the rails upon motor-cars
on their way to work.</p>

<p>Many years ago, one Minor C. Keith, while building
a railway in Costa Rica, hit upon the idea of
planting bananas along the line in order to provide
freight for his own road. When, during a financial
panic, he was unable to pay his laborers, he performed
the miracle of persuading them to work for
nine months without salary. He and his assistants
drained swamps and practically eliminated malaria
long before our Canal Zone doctors learned to combat
the fever-carrying mosquito. He formed a partnership
with one Andrew W. Preston, the first man
to transport bananas in any quantity to the United
States, and out of that combination grew the United
Fruit Company, which to-day has plantations in
Jamaica, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras,
Guatemala, and British Honduras, and controls the
banana industry of the world. It owns railways
throughout Central America, and operates its own
line of ships. It is said to make and unmake governments,
although no one ever proves the accusation.
It escapes prosecution in American courts as a monopoly
because its properties are mostly located in
foreign countries. But it has developed a large section
of jungle-land that once was considered worthless
and uninhabitable; the money it pays in taxes
for its concessions is the mainstay of more than one
Central-American nation’s finances; and it supplies
the world with bananas on a policy of “small profits
on a tremendous scale.”</p>

<p>Guatemala is one of its smallest production
sources, and Quiriguá is one of its smallest Guatemalan
plantations, yet I spent an entire day riding
through the banana groves on a motor-car with a
superintendent, and saw but a small part of them.</p>

<p>“The banana’s the easiest thing on earth to grow,”
explained my guide, as the little car hummed over
the endless tracks. “You just select the right land&mdash;the
silt of some river bottom&mdash;and burn off the
jungle. Then you plant them&mdash;using the suckers, or
bulbs that spring up around an old tree&mdash;set them
out in rows. And there’s nothing more to do except
keep them clear of brush. In eight months you’ve
got bananas. The main problem is to pick them just
green enough so they’ll ripen by the time they reach
the States&mdash;a little bit greener for England&mdash;and
get them there when the home fruits are not in
season.”</p>

<p>From time to time we passed a row of laborers’
shacks. Some of the Jamaicans had brought their
own kinky-haired women with them. Others had
found Guatemalan girls. A host of picaninnies were
tumbling about each cottage. Now and then one
heard the rattle of dice, and a snatch of music from
a mouth organ.</p>

<p>“Most of the men are working to-day,” said the
superintendent. “We pay them by the job, and not
by the week. It brings more satisfactory results in
a warm climate. They like it, too, because they can
work when they please. But this is a boat day, and
we’ve taught them to work on boat days.”</p>

<p class="center space-above"><span class="figcenter" id="i_027">

</span></p>
<p class="center">A BANANA-BOAT LOADING ON THE EAST COAST<br /></p>

<p>Negroes with <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">machetes</i> were cutting down the
bananas. A banana tree is only a soft, spongy
thing, like the stem of a huge lily. A blow of the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">machete</i> would half sever the trunk, and the tree
would bend, bringing the bunch of fruit within
reach. The negroes would hack away the leaves,
and remove the banana stalk carefully.</p>

<p>“When you cut down the tree, a lot of new ones
grow up around it. Most people don’t know that.
They tell about a new superintendent here that got
all excited because the men were chopping down the
grove. And we always kid new men by sending them
for a ladder on their first boat day.”</p>

<p>One bruised banana will rot, and contaminate an
entire ship load, wherefore they were handled with
great care. They were piled along the track on a
prepared bed of leaves. When the pick-up train
passed, other negroes shouldered each bunch gently.
They might toss it aboard, but other negroes caught
it by each stem, without touching the fruit, and laid
it upon another bed of leaves.</p>

<p>“We shipped out three and a half million bunches
last year&mdash;and when we say ‘bunch’ we mean the
whole ‘bunch’ and not just a ‘hand’ with a dozen
bananas on it,” explained the superintendent. “No,
that popular song that everybody sang at home was
never heard down here. We’d have killed anybody
that dared to sing it. You should have been here
one day last week, just to see how sore everybody
was when the cook had the nerve to offer us sliced
bananas for breakfast. Nobody’d eat them.”</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>Every visitor to Guatemala makes the trip to
Quiriguá, not to see the plantation, but to observe
the famous Maya ruins hidden in the neighboring
jungles.</p>

<p>Like most famous sights which every one travels
far to see, they prove extremely disappointing.
Their only beauty is that one has to ride horseback
through a swamp to reach them, and that they are
so completely surrounded with tropical forest, which
forms an ideal setting. The ruins themselves,
although interesting, are not impressive. There are
some four straight columns about thirty feet high,
covered with intricate carving somewhat obscured
by mildew and moss. Each visiting archeologist
scrapes off the fungus in order to obtain a clearer
view of the carving, and with it scrapes off part of
the carving. Near the columns are a few other queer
rocks, fantastically cut to represent a frog or a turtle
or some other creature, whose significance no one
has been able to explain.</p>

<p>These are the work of the Mayas, who peopled
Yucatan and southern Mexico while the Aztecs occupied
the Mexican tableland. While the earlier
people of the north built pyramids, these people built
temples and monuments of lesser stature, but with
more elaborate ornamentation. They possessed a
system of hieroglyphics which have never been deciphered.
Supposedly, the ruins of Quiriguá were
erected to commemorate events in local history, but
they are small, as ruins go, and lack imposing grandeur.
Few ruins in the world can equal the marvelously-carved
Maya ruins of Yucatan, but these
of Quiriguá fail to astound the observer. Near
them, however, has recently been unearthed a fortress
upon a hilltop, a very rude fortress of small
stones, and scientists believe that marvelous discoveries
may yet be made by excavation&mdash;possibly
of a great Maya City buried long ago by the rotting
jungles.</p>

<p>Guatemala has only very recently taken an interest
in her past. In the capital I had met a Dr. T. T.
Waterman, now the official archeologist of the
Guatemalan government, who had just brought to
light on the Pacific Coast some ancient carvings
more impressive to me than those of Quiriguá.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t say I discovered them,” he explained,
as he showed me photographs of statuary wherein
faces and figures were not the fantastic work usually
performed by primitive artists, but extremely real
and life-like&mdash;altogether quite the best sculpture
that I had seen in these countries.</p>

<p>“In fact, I didn’t discover them,” Dr. Waterman
continued. “Ex-president Herrera did. They were
on his coffee finca at Pantaleon. They happened to
be on good farming land, so he dumped them all on
his rubbish heap. That’s where I found them.”</p>

<p>When the bosses at Quiriguá heard this story,
they looked at their own monuments&mdash;which tourists
came miles to see&mdash;and shook their heads sadly.</p>

<p>“Those damned things are on our best banana
land, too.”</p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p>On the train that carried me back from Quiriguá&mdash;through
swamp, and desert and mountain&mdash;from
banana-land to coffee-country&mdash;I met an Old-Timer.
He had been so long in the tropics that the mosquitoes
refused to bite him. Like many another, he
had the rank of General, earned in some long-past
revolution.</p>

<p>“These countries are changing,” he said regretfully.
“I can remember the time when there was
nothing down here but thatched huts. All the white
men in those days were tropical tramps, drifting
from one place to another, but they’ve mostly
disappeared. This Fruit Company won’t give you
a job these days unless you come down on contract,
with a white collar around your neck, and a testimonial
from your clergyman.</p>

<p>“The tramp’s gone south. And now the soldier of
fortune is passing. You no sooner get a revolution
started than the United States sends down a gunboat
to protect American property. Things are getting
so civilized around here, I sometimes think of going
home and joining the Ku Klux Klan for a little excitement.”</p>

<small>IN SUNNY SALVADOR</small></h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>A mule trail leads overland from Guatemala
to Salvador&mdash;a rugged, bowlder-strewn path
that curls along mountain sides, and fords
rivers, and scales precipitous cliffs&mdash;a road such as
only a mule could travel with security and comfort.</p>

<p>I crossed it in an automobile.</p>

<p>The chauffeur&mdash;evidently a revolutionist keeping
in practice at risking his life&mdash;drove out of Guatemala
City with myself and another <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i> passenger,
at four in the morning, and raced through the
black night with the shrieking claxon characteristic
of all Latin-American motor traffic, past the sleeping
suburbs and up the heights to the first narrow
ledge.</p>

<p>There, while the car still raced at full speed above
a sheer drop of several hundred feet, he removed
both hands from the wheel to light a cigarette.</p>

<p>This was merely the beginning. A protest from
his American passengers would have delighted him,
and furnished bar-room anecdotes for the next ten
years. Wherefore Shields&mdash;a lean lank Yankee
salesman from the Middle West&mdash;smiled cheerfully
as though he were having the time of his life, and I
followed his example.</p>

<p>The trail was not merely narrow, but it squirmed
and twisted, following the scalloped contour of the
mountainside. The driver took the curves without
use of brake. As a matter of fact, he explained
later, the brakes did not work. So we sped unchecked
around and around the many bends, until,
making a particularly abrupt turn, we collided with
an ox-cart.</p>

<p>This stopped us with a crash. The ox-cart overturned.
A load of melons, bound for the Guatemalan
market, rolled down the slopes, starting a
small landslide. The oxen, bumped off the road,
pawed frantically for a foothold on the brush-grown
decline. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peon</i> marketer glowered in sullen resentment.
Our chauffeur lighted another cigarette,
climbed out to survey his twisted fender and his
awry lamps, produced a flask of cognac and took a
comforting swig, climbed back again to discover
that his car would still run, and drove away as fast
as before.</p>

<p>The road grew steadily worse. Our seat-springs
were in the same condition as the brakes. This
scarcely mattered, since we so seldom touched them,
but spent most of the journey somewhere midway
between the seat and the awning, contriving as a
rule to miss the steel framework of the top, but
clinging to the sides lest we puncture the canvas
above us.</p>

<p>Our most difficult task was to maintain a cheerful,
dignified expression of countenance for the benefit of
observers along the road. Dawn brought the entire
population out to see us. Barefooted <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peons</i>&mdash;men,
women, and children&mdash;came racing across the fields
at the shriek of our claxon, to obtain a closer view.
It was now three years since the first automobile had
crossed this trail&mdash;an achievement hailed at the time
by marveling editorials in the local Central-American
press&mdash;and motor traffic was becoming a fairly
regular thing, but not so regular that the novelty
had diminished. In fact, the chickens of the region
had not yet learned to jump across the road in front
of the car. The other species of livestock were more
apt, however, in acquiring the customs of civilization.
The dogs chased us with outraged yelps. The
cows, always lying in the center of the road, lurched
to their feet directly in our path. Horses and
donkeys, convinced that we were after them and
were as apt to catch them in the woods as on the
trail, stuck to the trail, and galloped ahead of us for
mile after mile without turning aside, while their
indignant owners trotted behind us, hurling imprecations,
and describing us as cattle-rustlers.</p>

<p>Boys, and occasionally grown men, took delight
in standing loutishly in the center of the street at
each village, making faces at us to amuse their admiring
friends, and leaping aside at our approach.
If we stopped at one of the infrequent towns, as we
usually did&mdash;in order that the chauffeur might again
produce his cognac flask&mdash;the whole population surrounded
us to stare. On such occasions Shields
would reach out and remove five-cent pieces from
the ears of the natives within reach of his arm&mdash;a
diversion practiced with much amusement by Richard
Harding Davis on his travels in Central
America&mdash;with the result that the local police were
frequently called upon for the return of the money
discovered in local ears.</p>

<p>These policemen took our names at each stopping-place&mdash;a
custom in vogue throughout both Guatemala
and Salvador whenever strangers make their appearance&mdash;but
they allowed us to inscribe our own
nomenclature, wherefore, should any list of distinguished
tourists ever be published in these countries,
the public will be amazed at the many world-famous
notables who have made the overland journey.
The policemen, unable to read, always bowed
profoundly, and if we inquired of them where gasoline
might be purchased, they would hop upon the
running-board, and show us the way, bowing again
for a two-cent tip.</p>

<p>The road, having scaled the first mountain range,
crossed a wide plateau. This was a cattle country.
From time to time a cloud of dust appeared before
us, indicating another drove of steers, and the chauffeur
headed always for the exact center of it, sometimes
plowing through without missing a steer, but
usually dispersing the herd in all directions, whereupon
native cowpunchers waved their arms and
screamed curses and rode frantically away to
round up their galloping protégés.</p>

<p>Having crossed the plateau, we came upon
the worst roads of all. The chauffeur gave his
wheel a twist, and we started up a river-bed, where
a frothing stream tumbled down over a succession of
huge bowlders. No one but a Latin-American, fortified
with cognac, could have driven a car up those
rapids. The water sprinkled us, and blinded us.
But up we went, the auto climbing from rock to rock,
much as a man might pull himself hand over hand up
a steep embankment. One wheel would catch; down
would jolt the other three wheels; the motor would
roar; another wheel would catch; another roar; a
lurch that made the teeth chatter; another roar; a
few feet of progress; a few feet of sliding backward&mdash;</p>

<p>Somehow, we made it. Leaving Guatemala behind,
we raced through Salvador, around another
series of cliffs where the chauffeur kept looking
backward to see whether we flinched, and at last
down into the valleys of another fertile coffee country,
just as night descended, and the askewness of
our damaged lamps made driving still more difficult.
Long trains of ox-carts, returning from the Salvadorean
markets, loomed out of the blackness before
us. But still we charged ahead, missing most of
them, and arrived at eight o’clock&mdash;still breathing,
though very much bruised&mdash;in Santa Ana, the second
city of the republic.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Salvador is the smallest nation in Central America,
but with the exception of Costa Rica the most
progressive.</p>

<p>The railway train which carried me to the capital
the next day was neat and clean, and the coaches
freshly painted by an artist who had covered the interior
with bright colors, and had traced designs of
lilies and tulips wherever there was sufficient woodwork
to permit of ornamentation.</p>

<p><span id="Guatemala">As in Guatemala,</span> the way led through a land of
volcanoes, wherewith Salvador is so abundantly supplied
that for some years she did not bother to construct
lighthouses on her coast. At a distance, from
the railway train, one could count several of them,
some in mild eruption. For miles we rode through
a congealed river of metal, a great stream that
traced its way downward through the green of
Mount San Salvador&mdash;a tumbled river of black rock
that had hardened into fantastic shapes while still
foaming and boiling. But already it had decomposed
in places, and islands of green jungle were
appearing along its surface.</p>

<p>Salvador, like Guatemala, is mainly a coffee
country. It is not, however, a country of large estates,
but of small holdings. Patches of farm-land
cover every available space. This is the most
thickly populated republic not only in Central
America but in the entire hemisphere. Into its 7,225
square miles were packed some 1,500,000 people.
As everywhere, over-crowding, by intensifying the
struggle for existence, had developed among the
Salvadoreans an energy and industry greater than
that of their neighbors. Hillsides that would have
gone to waste in Guatemala were plowed here to the
very summit. Villages, ruined by the last volcanic
eruption, were springing up in all the valleys.</p>

<p>One looked upon the heavily populated landscape
and wondered why some of the natives did
not gravitate over into the next republic. But
the people of all these nations are like those of
the Balkans in their hatred of one another. When I
mentioned the subject to a Salvadorean who shared
my seat, he muttered:</p>

<p>“Go to Guatemala? Never! People there are
scoundrels!”</p>

<p>Which reminded me that Guatemalans had already
warned me against the Salvadoreans, all of
whom were said to be cut-throats and purse-snatchers.
It is this spirit of mutual distrust that has kept
Central America divided into five diminutive states.
There has been talk of union ever since they first
gained independence from Spain and Mexico back in
1821 and 1823, but it has resulted only in a series
of temporary combinations of two or three republics,
opposed by the other three or two, and brought to an
end through internal bickerings. Politicians in all
the countries favor the present multiplicity of offices.
Wherefore each little nation staggers under the burden
of supporting a president, and a congress, and
a complete diplomatic corps, although the whole five
could be lost in Texas.</p>

<p>Salvador, the smallest, is so tiny that from its
center one could sometimes look westward to the
Pacific Ocean, and eastward to the mountains of
Honduras.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>If Salvador sometimes indulges in what the people
of larger nations describe as “comic opera,” it is
normally peaceful.</p>

<p>It appeared so tranquil at the time of my visit that
I was surprised to learn of its being under martial
law.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s easily explained,” said the gentleman
who shared my seat. “Our president, Alfonso Quiñonez
Molina, is a very excellent man, but he has his
enemies. Under martial law, he can draft any one
into the army. As <span id="critic">soon as an opponent criticizes</span>
him, he makes him a General. Thus the critic becomes
susceptible to military discipline, and ventures
no further criticism.”</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>A few hours of leisurely travel brought me to San
Salvador, the capital of El Salvador.</p>

<p>It was a warm, sunny capital, only a trifle over
two thousand feet in altitude, extremely low for a
Central-American city. Its population numbered
only some fifty or sixty thousand. Its people, being
of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mestizo</i> composition, did not affect the barbaric
raiment of the Guatemalan Indians. The half-breed
maidens wrapped themselves in filmy shawls of pink
or blue, but after the blazing <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">serapes</i> of the previous
country these garments seemed colorless. The city
itself was somewhat drab. A few of its structures
were of the heavy masonry found elsewhere in Central
America, and its Governmental Palace was imposing
in its wealth of marble columns, yet the city
as a whole&mdash;being another favorite objective of the
local earthquakes&mdash;was constructed mainly of wood
and corrugated iron, even to the cathedral, which,
although painted to suggest stone, was convincing
only at a distance.</p>

<p>But it was a decidedly pleasant city, with many
parks and tinkling fountains. Pretty <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señoritas</i>
were abundant. Priests in black robes&mdash;unrestricted
by law in this country&mdash;were to be seen everywhere.
Men walked through the market-places ringing
dinner bells, and carrying little boxes containing
a tiny image of the Virgin, to Whom one might bow
for a penny. Horse cars rattled through the streets
with much crackling of the drivers’ whips. There
was music each night in the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>, and flirtation beneath
the palm trees. The tropic air was balmy and
soothing. About the whole city there was an atmosphere
of contentment&mdash;and a touch of that fictional
romance which the traveler craves.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Deciding to stay for a while, I took lodgings at
a cheap hotel opposite the Presidential Palace.</p>

<p>In all of these countries the homes of the wealthy
and influential citizens&mdash;even of the president&mdash;are
quite apt to be located between business offices, or
stores, or even among slums. Because of the local
habit which wealth frequently manifests of shrinking
into concealment behind a plain exterior, the
magnificent homes are apt to be no more striking in
outward appearance than their inglorious surroundings.
The palace, a plain one-story building, was
recognizable as such only from the large guard of
colonels and generals who lined its sidewalk, and
from the presence just across the way of the principal
military barracks, with protruding towers from
which machine-guns could sweep the surrounding
streets in case of insurrection.</p>

<p>My room had doors opening directly upon the
avenue. If I chanced to open them in the evening, I
caught a flash of eyes from one feminine stroller
after another, for this region despite its distinction
was a favorite haunt of street-walkers, somewhat
numerous in Salvador as a result of a preponderance
of females, a tropical climate, and the difficulty
of earning a living which always accompanies
an excess of population. From the opposite sidewalk,
the colonels and generals would smile and
twirl their moustachios, and the policeman on the
corner would offer advice:</p>

<p>“That’s a good one! I know her myself!”</p>

<p>For variety, there was an occasional religious
procession&mdash;the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pase de la virgin</i>. At certain times
in the year, the priests at the many churches would
send out the image of the Virgin to make a tour of
the city, spending a night at the home of each parishioner
who chose to receive Her. Every evening a
long parade of women would pass my hotel, marching
very slowly, each holding aloft a lighted candle,
and chanting in a shrill strained voice.</p>

<p>One night, out of curiosity, I followed them. It
was strangely impressive&mdash;the winding procession
of solemn women, intent upon the image before
them, singing a weird hymn that rose and fell and
echoed through the silent streets&mdash;the candles flaming
aloft, as though this were all a great stream of
fire creeping very slowly through the heart of the
city. The family that was to receive the image came
to meet us, also bearing candles, and led us to the
house, where in one corner of the parlor a great
stage had been constructed and decked with palms.
The head of the family, seeing a foreigner in the
crowd, hastened to welcome me.</p>

<p>“You honor my household, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>. Come early
to-morrow night, and I shall let <em>you</em> carry the Virgin.”</p>

<p>They bore Her reverently into the house, and
placed Her upon the improvised Altar. For several
minutes, they stood before Her, and the chant reverberated
through the room, vastly impressive. Then,
as though to shatter the whole effect, some woman
shrieked in a loud voice:</p>

<p>“Who’s the cause of such great joy and happiness?”</p>

<p>From the crowd the answer came in a mighty
roar, profanely like a college yell:</p>

<p>“The Virgin Mary!”</p>

<p>They trooped noisily into the street. All was
over. The solemnity was gone. As I came out,
several of the girls, so intent before upon their
hymn, favored me with a flash of eyes. I recognized
them as those who regularly passed my hotel door.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The Central-American, like the Mexican, is both an
idealist and a materialist. He sees no inconsistency
in being both devoutly religious and frankly immoral.</p>

<p>He is quite apt to use the name of his favorite
saint as a fitting title for his gin mill. He employs
it as a harmless ejaculation. He may even resort
to it for emphasis, as in the case of an advertisement
I recall, which endorsed a Charlie Chaplin moving
picture with the phrases: “Is it funny? Jesus,
Joseph, and Mary!” And, among the lower classes,
he is quite apt to regard any religious holiday as a
fitting excuse for over-indulgence in liquor.</p>

<p>It is frequently charged throughout these countries
that the great waves of illegitimacy follow the
principal church processionals, which fact is not a
reflection upon the church, but upon the inability of
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peons</i> to associate the ideas of religion and personal
behavior. In fact, the common people see
nothing essentially wrong, or even unusual, in illegitimacy
itself. In Nicaragua, the newspapers in publishing
a list of births, distinguish each new citizen
with the candid “legitimo” or “ilegitimo,” and the
latter outnumber the former by two or three to one,
a ratio which holds good for all these countries.</p>

<p>It must not be assumed from these statements,
however, that all Central America is a hotbed of
immorality. In discussing any moral question, a
writer must indicate which social class he has in
mind. In any of these countries there is a distinct
division between the aristocrat and the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peon</i>.</p>

<p>In aristocratic circles, a man has every privilege,
and a woman none. It is assumed, in Latin fashion,
that boys will be boys. Lest girls be girls, their virtue
is assured by a close chaperonage. A man of
wealth may keep several establishments in town
beside his regular home, if bound upon a journey,
he may take with him some other lady in order that
his wife may be spared the discomforts of travel.
The wife remains a model of propriety. Here prevails
the double standard.</p>

<p>In <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peon</i> circles, both sexes share something more
of equality. They mate usually without the formality
of marriage. Should they prefer to change
partners from time to time, they do it casually, yet
this is the exception rather than the rule. In some
cases, a woman objects to any ceremony, preferring
to remain free of ties, so that in case her new spouse
proves a drunkard or a wife-beater, she can leave
him, for there is no divorce in most of these countries.
In some cases, they would prefer the marriage
ritual, but can not afford it. And in most
cases, although free to change partners, they
remain faithful throughout life. Women in this
class, so long as they have a consort, are apt
to be as loyal as the women of the upper classes.
Illegitimate children, consequently, are more a result
of these informal unions than of a general
promiscuity.</p>

<p>Yet promiscuity is not unknown. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peon</i> girl
without a partner is the daughter of a rather sensuous
race, and of a race that is not inclined to work
when an easier living is to be obtained. In this land
of tolerance, little stigma attaches itself to her or to
her children if she takes up prostitution as a
career. In most Latin-American countries, she
is restricted to a certain segregated district, but she
is recognized by the police as a legal and useful
member of the community. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gente decente</i>, or
decent people, as the aristocrats describe themselves,
may not invite her to their homes, but the
gentlemen may sometimes call at hers.</p>

<p>If, in San Salvador, she chooses to ply her trade
before the presidential palace, what matters it? She
does not molest the president. And if she chooses
also to join a religious procession, and return immediately
to her profession, the Central-American
sees nothing inconsistent therein. What has religion
to do with one’s personal affairs?</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>These people, of whatever class, are naturally
tolerant toward one another.</p>

<p>A man may be strictly moral, and many of them
are, even in aristocratic circles, yet he never takes it
upon himself to enforce a similar morality on his
neighbor. There are no organizations in Mexico or
Central America for minding other people’s business.
The only society engaged in uplifting the
fellow of different viewpoint in these parts is one
with offices at Albany, New York, which sends out
propaganda to combat the evil of bull-fighting.</p>

<p>Whether one wishes to raise the devil or not, one
has a comfortable sense of liberty here which is lacking
in Anglo-Saxon lands. If one chooses to drink,
and to become disgracefully drunk, to such an extent
that we at home would remark the next day,
“You certainly were a mess last night!”, there is
no such comment forthcoming from a Latin American.
Like the little General at Culiacán, the native
of any of these countries will say, “You were very
lively last evening.”</p>

<p>Perhaps the wife of his hotel proprietor will even
compliment him. “After sixteen <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">copitas</i> of Scotch
whiskey, you did not molest a single one of my
servant-girls,” she will say. “You have a remarkably
fine character, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>!”</p>

<p>And he sobers up, feeling that he has been a paragon
of virtue.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>If these people seldom criticize harshly, however,
they are very fond of gossip. The women especially
have few interests to discuss, and infinite leisure for
the discussion.</p>

<p>There were some fifteen <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señoras</i> and <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señoritas</i> at
my hotel in San Salvador, the wives or daughters of
guests, all of them built to resist earthquake, who
spent the entire day sitting in a chair upon the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i>
veranda, without amusement or occupation. Anglo-Saxon
girls, with nothing to do except to wait for a
husband to come home from work, would have gone
insane, but these of Salvador were passively content.
None of them ever read anything; in fact only a very
few people of either sex ever seem to read anything
in these countries; few of them ever sewed or
knitted; all of them were quite satisfied with their
peaceful existence.</p>

<p>During the absence of their husbands, they were
extremely circumspect. When spouses were present,
they might greet me with a pleasant, “Good
morning.” When alone, they affected not to see me.
Since the Latin-American gentleman, unless patently
snubbed, fancies always that a lady must be encouraging
amorous advances, they had learned to be extremely
cautious.</p>

<p>But they all had a great curiosity about the United
States&mdash;which newspapers had taught them to regard
as a country whose population spent most of
its time in a divorce court&mdash;and they were eager to
ask me questions. Wherefore they would gather in
a body, and reassured by the security of numbers,
would occasionally surround me for purposes of conversation.</p>

<p>Since the feminine mind runs mainly to romance,
their questions were rather personal. The women
here always wish to know whether the man they meet
is married or single, and if single, whether he has a
sweetheart. On the theory that the lack of a sweetheart
would interest them most, I had always answered
questions in the negative, but in San Salvador
I discovered that by inventing one I merely interested
them the more. The news spread rapidly,
and within two minutes every woman in the hotel
was present to ask further questions about her.</p>

<p>“Is she beautiful?”</p>

<p>“No, she’s about as ugly as they make them.”</p>

<p>That provoked much discussion. These strange
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringos</i> did not care for beauty! Had one not seen
many an American bringing with him a wife that no
Latin would have wed?</p>

<p>“But what does she look like? Six feet tall!
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Dios!</i> And wears number ten shoes! <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Ay, carramba!</i>
Do you really love her?”</p>

<p>Night after night they asked questions about her,
until I regretted her invention. If friends or relatives
came to see my inquisitors, the entire story
had to be repeated again. I finally decided to let her
marry another. But this merely invited further inquiries.</p>

<p>“Are you not disconsolate? No! Ay, what unfeeling
creatures are the Americans! And she
married a man of ninety years for his millions!
How commercial the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringos</i>!”</p>

<p>Sympathy and comfort were offered in abundance.
Each of the ladies seemed to have a friend or relative
who was suggested as a substitute. I was forced
to decline the suggestions.</p>

<p>“We are merely waiting, my sweetheart and I,
until the old millionaire dies. Then we shall inherit
his wealth, and live happily ever after.”</p>

<p>There was a moment of shocked silence. Some
one suggested that I was joking, but was immediately
overruled by the others. This, they insisted,
was a common practice in the United States. Anything
was possible among Americans! And was I
not even jealous that I must wait while my beloved
lived with another?</p>

<p>“Not at all. I’ve cabled a second girl, and she’ll
be my wife until the first one is free. We do that
regularly.”</p>

<p>My love affairs became the sensation of the community.
And the story did not reach the breaking
point until the first girl, in the furor of her love for
me, announced in an imaginary cable that she had
poisoned her husband, and that the millions were
ours. Even then, there were several doubtful inquiries
as to whether I really meant it. And when
I confessed that the whole story was fictitious, they
were vastly disappointed. It was all so in keeping
with their visions of the United States that they
wished to believe it.</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>In all of these women one observed a strangely
child-like quality.</p>

<p>When better conversational subjects were exhausted,
several of them requested that I guess their
ages. Oddly enough, in this land where frankness
is seldom encountered, women make no effort to
hide the number of their years. Perhaps it is
because their personal vanity, so very manifest in
younger girls, practically ceases after marriage has
been achieved.</p>

<p>One of them I judged to be fifty. To please her
I guessed forty. She proved in reality to be thirty-two.
They grow old so quickly here. Yet in their
manner they retain toward men that air of a child
toward a parent. Should a husband see fit to discuss
with them any serious subject, they listen in
awed admiration to his opinions, exclaiming occasionally,
“I see! Ah, I understand!”</p>

<p>It would probably offend the average Latin-American
to discover that his spouse knew as much
about anything as he did himself. He likes the rôle
of the patient mentor. He prefers that his wife
be a gentle pet rather than a comrade. I dined one
day with a Salvadorean gentleman and his wife;
the lady, who came from one of the leading families,
had been educated abroad and had traveled extensively;
yet the gentleman, although he conversed
quite brilliantly with the men at the table, chattered
only playful nonsense to his wife. In consideration
of his pride, she artfully concealed the fact that she
was his intellectual equal.</p>

<p>Now and then one reads in our newspapers or
magazines about the equal suffrage movement in
Mexico or the organization of a new women’s club
in Chile. But such innovations have yet to gain an
extensive following. With the same conflict of idealism
and materialism that distinguishes Latin-American
men, the women may verbally deplore their lack
of liberty but are in reality quite satisfied with it.
They are of a race which is inclined to follow the
easiest course, and the easiest course is to attach
themselves to some convenient man and allow him
to worry about life’s problems. In these pleasant
tropical countries no girl of the lower classes
escapes maternity; most girls of the middle classes,
not being over-critical about whom they marry, can
land some one; even in the more particular aristocratic
circles the spinster is a rarity. The wife usually
has her own way when questions arise about the
household or the children. Beyond that she is quite
content with complete male dominance. And she is
passively happy.</p>

<p class="center">IN THESE PLEASANT TROPICAL COUNTRIES NO PEON GIRL
ESCAPES MATERNITY<br /></p>

<p>So accustomed are the Latin-Americans to the
timid, gently-shrinking type of woman that they
usually misunderstand the visiting American girl.
When the native gentlemen observe her chatting with
masculine acquaintances upon the street in her
frankly carefree manner, they leap immediately to
the conclusion that she is of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demi-monde</i>. And
when a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i> informs them that her smiles mean
nothing, they shake their heads in wonderment.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Ay!</i>” they exclaim. “Your Anglo-Saxon females
are so cold! So unsentimental! Altogether sexless!”</p>

<p>They shake their heads again, in pity, reflecting
that the poor girl is missing all the most delicious of
life’s sensations. But since they are ever hopeful,
they linger awhile, to make sure that the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i> did
not err in stating that her smiles meant nothing.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>Salvador has the smallest foreign colony of any
Central-American country. Since it is entirely a
coffee country, and since Central-Americans are
essentially coffee planters, it has little need for outsiders.</p>

<p>It judges the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i> largely by the occasional
deluges of tourists who make the brief automobile
journey up from the port of La Libertad
during their “Go-from-New-York-to-Frisco-through-the-Panama-Canal”
trip. As this is the only
capital hereabouts that can be reached within a
couple of hours from the seacoast, they all rush up
the mountains to laugh at “one of those ridiculous
little countries that O. Henry used to write about!”</p>

<p>One group came up during my sojourn.</p>

<p>They came in five automobiles, pausing at the central
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i> to exclaim, “So this is Paris!” They
looked at the leading hotel&mdash;an unimpressive but
comfortable establishment&mdash;and roared, “There’s
the Ritz!” They stopped for dinner, and demanded
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">frijoles</i>, having learned the name of that dish from
Latin-American fiction, and being anxious to tell
their friends at home about a real native dinner.
They waited with much trepidation, having heard
that all native dishes were peppery. And when the
waiter brought <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">frijoles</i>, they screamed with laughter.</p>

<p>“We tried in every way to explain to that little
brown fellow that we wanted a native dinner,” each
would later tell the people at home, “and what do
you think he brought us? Beans! Just think of it!
Beans!”</p>

<p>After lunch they rode about town again. The
monument in the central <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i> interested them.
The suspender-manufacturer from Buffalo called it
“Napoleon crossing the Delaware.” Great applause
greeted the sally. Thereafter, pleased with
his success, the wit rode through town standing up
in the front seat, and shouting through megaphoned
hands his descriptions of the other sights.</p>

<p>Old-Timers damned him, as they always damn the
tourist.</p>

<p>“He’s the sort,” they said, “that brings us all
into disrepute.”</p>

<p>But the natives merely smiled. They were accustomed
to this oft-repeated phenomenon. When
asked their opinion of the tourists, they merely replied,
“All of them seemed very jolly, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>.”</p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p>The sort of American who brings us all into disrepute
is, in reality, a much over-damned specimen.
He is a comparative rarity. Most travelers, and
most permanent residents in Latin America, go out
of their way to show themselves congenial and sympathetic
to the natives.</p>

<p>We travel-writers love to picture the gruff, impolite
American because he shows the reading public
by contrast that we are cultured, considerate persons,
with an international breadth of mind that enables
us to appreciate foreign countries and foreign
customs.</p>

<p>But the offensive fellow-countryman does exist.</p>

<p>“It is not so much that he is a low-class American,”
explained a Salvadorean gentleman with unusual
frankness. “Usually he is one who behaves
very decently at home. Here he feels at liberty, in
his disrespect for a small country, to do as he
pleases. One of your diplomatic representatives a
few years ago was expelled from the social club at
Tegucigalpa, because when drunk he would go out
upon the balcony to whoop and cheer and cast things
at the pedestrians below.”</p>

<p>Our diplomatic and consular corps has sobered up
since the days of O. Henry, and the typical representative
of our State Department no longer sits in his
hammock with a gin bottle, throwing banana peelings
at the parrot. But this incident I was able later
to verify. And there was one incident more.</p>

<p>“Not long ago, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>, two Americans came over
the trail from Guatemala in an automobile, and when
asked for their names by our police, they inscribed
everything from the Prince of Wales to Jack Johnson.
The authorities are tracing them now, and if
we catch them, they shall learn what it means to
show such insult to El Salvador!”</p>

<p>Salvador was a very pleasant place, but I decided
to drift along. Anyhow, news had just arrived that
a revolution was threatening in Honduras, the next
republic on my itinerary. So I started in haste for
Honduras.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />
<small>THE REVOLUTION IN HONDURAS</small></h2></div>




<h3>I</h3>

<p>I started in haste for Honduras, but haste
achieved nothing in these lands.</p>

<p>One of the eccentricities of the average Central-American
republic is that the traveler has little
difficulty in entering the country, yet having entered,
finds his departure balked by countless formalities.
Apparently the government is eager to welcome any
one, but if it can discover that the visitor is a rapscallion,
is determined to add him to the permanent
population.</p>

<p>Slipping into Salvador through the back yard, I
was not required even to display a passport. On
the day preceding my intended departure from the
Capital, I learned that I must call upon the Secretary
of Foreign Relations, and convince His Excellency
of my respectability before I should be permitted
to leave.</p>

<p>A pretty <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señorita</i> in the outer office of the State
Department ceased powdering her nose to listen to
my plea.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Cómo no?</i> Why not, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>? If you will kindly
return the day after to-morrow&mdash;”</p>

<p>She smiled sweetly in dismissal, and having settled
the matter in the favorite Latin-American fashion,
reopened her vanity case, upon the mirror of
which was pasted the photograph of her sweetheart,
who seemed even more important than this affair of
State. Gringo-like, I persisted.</p>

<p>“How about to-day?”</p>

<p>“Impossible, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>. The Secretary is in conference.
And the Sub-secretary has gone home.”</p>

<p>“Where does he live?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Quién sabe?</i> Who knows, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>?”</p>

<p>Evidently annoyed at my insistence, she finally
discovered a clerk who professed that he did know.
He wrote out the address for me: “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Numero &mdash;, Calle
10 Poniente</i>.” It was only the middle of the morning,
but it was already fairly hot in San Salvador.
I hiked through sun-blanched streets, only a few of
which were numbered. At length I asked a policeman
for directions. He glanced at my perspiring
forehead, and assured me that I was now at the
Tenth Street <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Poniente</i>.</p>

<p>So I knocked at the proper number, and inquired
of a servant whether His Excellency were at home.
I learned that he was. A colored gentleman in pajamas
rose from a hammock in the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i>, and shook
hands very cordially. Not to be outdone in politeness,
I made an elaborate speech, emphasizing my
regret at having to leave his delightful country, and
begging that he would do me the favor to grant permission.</p>

<p>“The permission is yours, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>!”</p>

<p>“Do I not require your visé on my passport?”</p>

<p>“Not mine, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>, but that of the Sub-Secretary
of Foreign Relations. I am only an humble employee
of the street-cleaning department. But
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">muchas gracias</i> for your visit. Always my house
is yours, at Numero &mdash;, <em>Seventh</em> Street <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Poniente</i>.”</p>

<p>When I did reach the <em>Tenth</em> Street <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Poniente</i>, it
was to discover that the address given me at the
State Department was wrong. His Excellency lived
somewhere else. But at last, after four hours of a
house-to-house canvass, I found him. Having obtained
the necessary visé, I caught the first train to
La Unión, on the Gulf of Fonseca, from which one
could look across a strip of blue water and see the
hills of Honduras itself.</p>

<p>“How soon can I catch a boat?” I inquired.</p>

<p>The citizens of La Unión shrugged their shoulders.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the day after to-morrow, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>, or the
day after that. But <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">quién sabe</i>? In the meantime
you had better visit the local <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">commandante</i> to secure
permission.”</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>As a matter of fact, the boat did not leave for
several days.</p>

<p>La Unión was the usual type of Central-American
port town&mdash;a colorless, uninteresting little city,
with numerous buzzards hopping about its mud-flats,
as hot as blazes, and devoid of entertainment.</p>

<p>I was welcomed at a small hotel with an inquiry
as to whether I possessed a watch. No one knew
the time. But since it was growing dark, the proprietor
assumed that it was nearing the hour for
supper. A slatternly maid brought out some tableware
that had barely survived the last earthquake,
and served the usual Central-American meal of
beans, rice, beans, chicken, beans, coffee, and more
beans.</p>

<p>On the hotel wall a notice proclaimed that this
establishment was preferred not only by tourists,
but by people of good taste. Its principal attraction
seemed to be Berta, its beautiful bar-maid. Berta,
although a rather dark-complexioned young person,
had a pleasant smile that revealed the whitest of
teeth. She took great care of those teeth. At five-minute
intervals, she rinsed them with a glass of
water, and expectorated upon the bar-room floor.
The town bachelors spent most of their idle hours&mdash;about
sixteen each day&mdash;whispering sweet nothings
to Berta, to which she smiled roguishly but shook
her head. Such was her popularity that she had
never learned to open a beer bottle. Whenever a
patron wished a drink, Berta had only to glance toward
the group of idlers, and some energetic young
man would step forward to open the bottle by chewing
off the top.</p>

<p>Berta was studying English. She would sit on
the counter, with a book before her, reciting: “Wan,
too, tree, fo-ur, fivvy, sixxy, ay-it, tenny.” The proprietor’s
wife sat beside her in a large armchair,
examining my photographs with untiring interest.
She was rather stout, and inclined either to head-ache
or stomach-ache or both. She fanned herself
with a palm-leaf fan, and groaned, and exclaimed
from time to time, “Ay! What heat it is making to-day!”
She would hold up each photograph, and inquire,
“What is this?” The inscription was written
on the back of each, but the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Señora</i> did not read
Spanish, much less English. Berta always interpreted
for her, with fantastic results: “A tee-pee-cal
stritty sinny een Gua-te-ma-la.” Then she would
smile again, and the scowls of the local swain would
suggest that if the boat did not sail pretty soon for
Honduras, the village buzzards would have a change
of diet.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>When the launch did leave for Honduras, there
was further formality. It was scheduled to depart <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">a
las nueve en punto</i>&mdash;at nine o’clock sharp&mdash;with
much verbal emphasis on the <em>sharp</em>. A squad of
Salvadorean soldiers manned the dock, and halted
me at my approach. My baggage was placed in the
office, and the door locked, and I was motioned to a
bench. Stevedores were loading the diminutive
vessel with a set of dilapidated furniture, which did
not appear worth transporting from one place to
another, but which was being appraised by a pompous
official, and duly taxed, while its owner waved
his hands and proclaimed that he was being robbed.
Official and owner finally adjourned to the governor’s
residence to settle the dispute, and did not
reappear until nearly noon.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the passengers waited. Cargo difficulties
having been adjusted, the pompous official
called each of us to the office in turn, collected a
small fee, and took our names and histories. He
then compiled a list, and sent it away to be typewritten
for presentation to the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">commandante</i> of
police. After another hour or two, the list reappeared,
covered with huge red seals, and flowing
signatures. There followed next a minute inspection
of baggage, which, in other lands, occurs only when
one enters the country. My notes aroused suspicion.
The inspector examined each page, pretending to
read it. Was I carrying away the country’s military
secrets? The eight barefoot soldiers gathered
closer, and glared suspiciously. These secrets were
important.</p>

<p>But at last we were permitted to embark, still with
formality. The soldiers lined up before the gangway.
The official read our names from the list, and
we embarked one by one, surveyed by the accusing
eyes of authority. The captain of the launch took
the wheel, and jangled a bell as a signal to the engineer
three feet behind him; the engineer jangled
another bell to let the captain know he had understood
the signal correctly. And we were off for
Honduras, visible just across the bay&mdash;at some hour
of mid-afternoon <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">en punto</i>.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>It was a brief voyage, through island-dotted waters
alive with pelicans and seagulls, to Amapala, the one
Honduranean port of entry on the Pacific, situated
upon a volcanic island.</p>

<p>Another official glanced idly at my passport, and
waved aside my baggage without examining it.
Several weeks later, when I departed, the same official
was to raise as much rumpus as the Salvadorean
authorities had raised, but to-day he offered no difficulties.
Within a few minutes, we were all back in
the launch, chugging toward the mainland, to San
Lorenzo, where commenced the automobile road to
the Honduran capital.</p>

<p>Arriving too late to catch the daily truck, we settled
ourselves for the night. San Lorenzo was
merely a ramshackle village of thatched huts in the
jungle, a village in keeping with Honduras’ reputation
as the most backward country in Central
America.</p>

<p>Two Chinamen, however, had opened a neat little
hotel there, and were ready for business. And there
was entertainment in plenty, for Hop On and Hop
Off, co-proprietors of the establishment, were engaged
in discharging their native servant. The
Honduranean, a big, niggerish-looking fellow with
murder in his eye&mdash;in both eyes, to be accurate&mdash;was
objecting to being discharged. He kept slouching
from table to table, picking up dishes, and
smashing them on the floor. Hop On and Hop Off
were going frantic with rage at each new act of vandalism,
but neither of them was of heroic stature,
wherefore they resorted to strategy rather than
force. They had taken shelter behind two doors at
opposite ends of the dining room, and would pop
out from concealment one at a time to shout curses
at their erstwhile employee. No sooner would the
Honduranean rush at one with his knife, than the
door would slam shut in his face, while the other
door opened and the other Hop screamed curses
from the opposite wall. Finally, tired with the exertion,
the big native accepted his discharge as final,
and strolled outside to tell his troubles to the rest
of the village, which had assembled to watch the excitement.</p>

<p>They were all ugly-visaged fellows. They lacked
the gentle suavity of the neighboring peoples. They
might have been no taller than Size B Irishmen, but
after one had dwelt among the Lilliputians of Guatemala,
they looked like giants. A taint of negro
blood was evident in their features, for Honduras&mdash;which
has a long strip of coast upon the Caribbean&mdash;was
in past years a favorite refuge for run-away
slaves from the West Indies, and its population to-day
is the most heterogeneous in Central America.
Little tufts of goat-like whiskers on chin and cheek
did not add to their personal beauty. Altogether,
this was the least charming race I had yet discovered
on my travels.</p>

<p>Having accepted his discharge as final, the servant
picked up an ax, and seated himself cross-legged
on the ground before the hotel, hoping apparently
that the Chinamen might venture outside into
the gathering dusk. They continued, however, to
revile him from the security of their two heavy
doors, until the audience tired and drifted away,
whereupon the quarrel seemed to die from lack of
interest, and the Honduranean himself, having
tossed the ax away with a gesture of disgust,
wandered off down the street.</p>

<p>Supper was finally served on such tableware as
remained unbroken. The village prostitute, aged
sixteen, then took the center of the stage, and recited
for our benefit the story of her life. While unfortunates
in most lands prefer not to air their sorrows
publicly, those of Latin America find a certain
dramatic pleasure in so doing. For the next two
hours the assembled guests heard the tale of her
marriage to the handsome Sebastiano, of Sebastiano’s
sudden death in an earthquake, and of the long
succession of gentlemen who had consoled her for
Sebastiano’s demise. Then some one bought her a
drink, and she vanished into the night.</p>

<p>Later, the Honduranean returned, this time with
a shot-gun. Thereupon the Chinamen bolted their
doors, and everybody retired to bed.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>I was awakened at 4 a.m. by a great pounding
upon my door.</p>

<p>Bill, a husky American truck-driver, was going up
to Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, and desired
company. The business-like Chinese were already
on the job with breakfast. We ate it in grouchy
early-morning silence, and drove off toward the
mountains through an inky-black fog.</p>

<p>“I know every inch of the way,” consoled Bill.
“There’ll be no trouble unless somebody takes a
shot at us, or blows up a bridge. They haven’t
started yet, but they’re likely to, any minute. Somebody
cut the telegraph wires last night.”</p>

<p>From time to time, as we raced through the darkness,
stern voices called upon us to halt. From the
road ahead a group of hard-faced natives would
emerge into the glare of our searchlights, covering
us with rifles. They were the federal soldiers, barefoot
and tattered, with nothing to distinguish them
from revolutionists. They examined my passport,
ransacked the cargo in search of arms or ammunition,
and finally permitted us to continue.</p>

<p>Eventually the sun made its appearance, revealing
the most broken of landscapes. The name
“Honduras” means depths, and the land is well
named. A forty-five degree slope was considered
fairly level here. On such grades, the peasants had
built their patches of cornfield. Even these patches
were infrequent, for the whole tumbled country
seemed to go straight up or down. The road itself
scaled precipitous heights, and twisted around narrow
cliffs, where the least mistake of a chauffeur
might send a car tumbling over and over into infinity.
It was all ruggedly beautiful, particularly
as we climbed into the coolness of six thousand feet
above the sea, where the hills were covered with
pines, but it was a cruel country&mdash;such a country as
discourages agriculture and effectually prevents the
transportation that might open up its vast store of
mineral wealth&mdash;a country suited only for warfare
and revolution. And from the time of the conquest
revolution has been its principal product.</p>

<p>Bill, however, who had lived here for something
over a decade, loved both the country and its
people.</p>

<p>“They’re all right, if you know how to handle ’em.
Take that boy of mine up there on the cargo. Mighty
good boy. I got ’im tied up with rope just now.
Came in drunk and kinder ugly last night. But he’s
comin’ out of it. I’ll buy him a bracer at the next
stop, and he’ll be all right. Best boy on the road.”</p>

<p>Bill spoke always with conviction. He finished off
each sentence with ejaculations suitable only to the
pulpit. Then he spat.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t go home for a million dollars. Can’t
stand the damned sissies back there. Give me
roughnecks! I ain’t got much use for them society
fellows. I’ve got a brother in Minneapolis. He was
a regular guy when we was kids. Could lick anybody
in school. But he made a lot of money and
married one of them fiddle-ly-diddle-lies, and went
all to pieces. I came home to see him two years
ago. He met me at the station with a big car, all
dressed up in a fur overcoat, and he says, ‘Bill,
you’re just in time for luncheon.’ I <em>looked</em> at him.
I says, ‘I guess you mean lunch, don’t you?’ He
took me to a regular mansion. Out came the fiddle-ly-diddle-ly.
He says, ‘Mable, may I present my
long-lost brother from Honduras?’ Christ! Why
couldn’t he say, ‘Bill, meet the old woman’? She
holds out her hand, way up in the air, like they do in
the movies, and says, ‘Charmed, I’m sure.’ God!”</p>

<p>He gave the wheel a violent twist, and we shot
around a mountain cliff. He drove along a narrow
precipice with one wheel almost hanging over the
rugged gulch below.</p>

<p>“They took me down to ‘luncheon.’ One of them
big English stiffs in a boiled shirt came out and gave
us each a little cup of soup and a cracker. I just
looked at my brother. ‘Joe,’ I says, ‘ain’t this lime-juicer
goin’ to give us nothin’ to eat?’ He says,
‘We’ll have dinner in the evening; you’ll soon get
accustomed to it.’ ‘Accustomed hell!’ I says; ‘to-night
I’ll be down in a restaurant, gettin’ a regular
feed. I’ll be eatin’ corn-beef and cabbage, same as
you used to eat. I ain’t sore at you, Joe, I’m disappointed.
You was a regular guy before you got
them society ideas. But you don’t make a sissy out
of me. I’m goin’ straight back to Honduras.’”</p>

<p>He drove along the precipice with savage relish.
Presently, as we passed a little native farm in a
rugged valley, he called my attention to it.</p>

<p>“That’s where <em>my</em> wife comes from. No fiddle-ly-diddle-ly
for me. She’s an Indian&mdash;pure-blooded
Indian&mdash;but she’s white&mdash;whiter’n you are&mdash;and a
damned good wife, too. We don’t take luncheon in
our house. We eat lunch. <em>Luncheon!</em> Christ!”</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>No one having shot at us from the hills or blown
up a bridge, we raced into Tegucigalpa in the early
afternoon.</p>

<p>Every one in the Capital was awaiting the revolution,
but the city remained unperturbed.</p>

<p>It was an old, weatherbeaten town. A river wandered
through it, bordered by high cement walls,
and spanned by an aged stone bridge of many
arches. The streets were hilly. Sidewalks might
be level, but after one had followed them for a certain
distance, one was apt to find himself ten feet
above the driveway, sometimes able to descend by
a flight of steps, but usually forced to jump or retrace
his way. The houses were aged and bullet-scarred.
If any of them had been constructed within
the past forty years, the climate had quickly given
it an appearance of venerability.</p>

<p>The central <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i> was unattractive. There were
a few palms and much purple bougainvillea, but
they were surrounded by a rickety railing green
with mildew, and interspersed with unattractive
monuments. The buildings facing the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i> were of
nondescript architecture. On one side was a yellowed
cathedral, with several varieties of weeds
sprouting in niches originally intended for images
of the saints. On another was a row of arched <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">portales</i>,
of flimsy wooden structure, housing several
courtrooms, a barber shop, a fashionable club, and
a number of cheap saloons. On the other two sides
were stores.</p>

<p>The most imposing edifice in the city was the
Presidential Palace. It stood upon the river bank,
towering above massive ramparts like an ancient
feudal castle. From its loop-holed walls machine-guns
could sweep the old Spanish bridge. And from
its windows the president could maintain a watchful
eye upon the National Treasury across the street&mdash;a
dilapidated old building whose contents at the
moment consisted principally of a national debt.</p>

<p class="center space-above"><span class="figcenter" id="i_029">
  <img src="images/029.jpg" class="w75"  alt="FROM HIS PALACE THE PRESIDENT COULD WATCH THE TREASURY
TO SEE THAT NO ONE STOLE THE NATIONAL DEBT" />
</span></p>
<p class="center">FROM HIS PALACE THE PRESIDENT COULD WATCH THE TREASURY
TO SEE THAT NO ONE STOLE THE NATIONAL DEBT<br /></p>

<p>Why any one should fight for possession of this
city, with its depleted finances, was a mystery later
explained.</p>

<p>“The government took in eight million <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pesos</i> last
year,” said a well-posted American resident, “and
only spent five million, yet it describes itself as
penniless, and pays only the soldiers and police,
keeping such employees as the school teachers waiting
six months for their salaries. Three million
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pesos</i>, almost half the country’s receipts, have disappeared.
That’s why everybody is constantly
squabbling for the presidency of the republic.
That’s why Tegucigalpa remains the most ramshackle
capital in Central America.”</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>The current political controversy was but a typical
incident in the history of Honduras.</p>

<p>The term of President Rafael López Gutiérres
had come to an end. During his two and a half
years of office, he had weathered thirty-three insurrections.
He was ready to retire. But his fellow
politicians, although they had already prospered to
the extent of three million pesos, demanded that he
follow the Central-American custom of turning over
his office to one of their own group, in order that
their prosperity might continue. And the President
gave his support to his personal friend, Bonilla.</p>

<p>At the elections recently held, there had arisen
two other candidates, Carías and Árias. Through
some oversight, the President had allowed a few of
their supporters to help in the counting of the ballots.
As a result, Carías led with fifty thousand
votes, Árias following with thirty-five thousand, and
Bonilla (the presidential favorite) bringing up the
rear with only twenty thousand. And although
Carías led, he failed to receive the absolute majority
required by the Constitution to insure his election.
It therefore devolved upon Congress to choose one
of the three. And Congress favored Árias. To
sum up the situation, the people preferred one candidate,
Congress another, and the President another.</p>

<p>A revolution appeared inevitable. The President
had declared martial law. Soldiers were everywhere.
One could distinguish them from civilians
because they carried rifles, and because when there
were two or more of them they marched one behind
the other in the center of the street, sometimes in
cadence. A few had blue uniforms, a few had khaki;
most of them wore whatever garments they happened
to be wearing when drafted. Many were
soldiers of fortune from neighboring countries&mdash;professional
scrappers called in by a President who
knew that his people were against him. They would
stop me on the street occasionally to ask that I lend
them a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peseta</i>&mdash;twenty-five cents&mdash;until pay-day,
but they impressed me as a doubtful risk.</p>

<p>The city was ablaze with election slogans, scribbled
with chalk upon every doorway&mdash;“Viva
Árias!”&mdash;“Viva Carrías!”&mdash;“Muerto Bonilla!”
Translated into “Live Árias,” “Live Carrías,”
and “Death to Bonilla,” they seemed indicative
of the earnest nature of Central-American
political campaigns. All three candidates were
now in the city. Each had a troop of his
followers living at his residence for protection.
One, who was stopping at the principal
hotel, was surrounded by twenty armed gunmen,
who sat about the bar-room and the lobby, scanning
everybody who entered, and ready to take a precautionary
shot at a member of another party. Each
had spies watching the others, to see that they did
not slip out of town to some assembly-point in the
mountains. Some day, one of them would do it. In
the meanwhile, the President in office kept a close
eye on all three. From time to time a detachment of
soldiers would come marching through town, bringing
to prison a party of conspirators caught hatching
insurrections in the neighboring villages.</p>

<p>The American Minister, Franklin Morales, was
holding daily conferences at the Legation, bringing
the candidates together in an effort to reach an
agreement. Each took turns making speeches about
his love of Honduras, his aversion to bloodshed, and
his earnest hope that the muddle might be solved
peacefully. When asked for a specific suggestion as
to the solution, each seemed to think that it could be
most satisfactorily achieved by the withdrawal of
the other two candidates.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, every one in Tegucigalpa ripped up
the boards of his floor, brought out the rifle and ammunition
secreted for such an emergency, and
waited for the fireworks. And the time-scarred old
Capital seemed to be saying to itself: “Another
revolution can’t do me any harm.”</p>

<p>But when I inquired as to just when the fireworks
would start, it developed that a revolution was as
undependable as transportation facilities had been.</p>

<p>“Who knows, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>? Perhaps the day after
to-morrow, <span id="perhaps">perhaps the day after that</span>. <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Quién
sabe?</i>”</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>I settled at a small hotel, where one enjoyed the
advantage of intimate association with a native
family.</p>

<p>There were only two other guests, but the family
was multitudinous. A young man had fallen in love
with the landlady’s daughter, and married her, and
had brought so many relatives of his own to live at
his mother-in-law’s expense, that they filled
all the rooms, until there was space only for three
boarders. Just how they all managed to exist on
the trifling income of the establishment was an unfathomable
mystery, but they contrived somehow
not only to feed and clothe themselves, but also to
keep a servant.</p>

<p>She was an anemic little girl in a tattered linen
dress. She was always smiling as she raced from
one room to another to answer a summons. Everybody
seemed to take fiendish delight in calling for
her. The cry of, “Petrona! Petrona!” echoed
across the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i> from morning until night. Even the
parrot had adopted the slogan, and throughout his
waking hours would screech, “Petrona!” And
Petrona, always cheerful, obeyed each call.</p>

<p>One of the other guests was a married lady, whose
husband had sent her to Tegucigalpa to keep her out
of the way of an expected battle elsewhere. With
the extreme faithfulness of Latin-American wives,
she locked herself in her room, to which Petrona
brought her meals. She emerged only to wash baby
clothes at the hotel pump, or to scream instructions
to her numerous progeny in the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i>&mdash;a noisy little
brood of future revolutionists who paid no heed to
her many injunctions.</p>

<p>The other guest was a Spaniard, who had just
come up from Nicaragua to bring twenty-four prize
game-cocks for Sunday’s rooster fight. He was a
tall, horse-faced, loquacious individual, who talked
continuously at the table, mostly in subtle smut. He
was an artist at the use of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">double entente</i>, and had
raised vulgarity above the level of pure nastiness, so
that it was now quite suitable for dinner-table conversation
in the presence of ladies. He was a jovial
person, predisposed toward the singing of love
songs, to which he could wave time with his knife
and never spill a bean. If his game-cocks won on
Sunday, he was planning to hire an airplane and
fly home to Nicaragua. He intended to load it with
beautiful women, and sail as close as possible to the
romantic tropical moon.</p>

<p>His roosters were tied to stanchions in the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i>.
They were continually glaring at one another, flapping
their wings, crowing challenges, and straining
at the cords that held each of them by the foot.
Whenever the Spaniard ceased his vigilance, one
of the married lady’s children was certain to unloose
a bird, and watch him peck a neighbor to death.
But on Saturday the survivors were sent to the
arena, packed into individual compartments in a
large wooden box, and thereafter the hotel was
peaceful. The box disappeared down the street on
the shoulders of a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peon</i>, accidentally inverted, so
that the game-cocks stood on their heads&mdash;an indignity
which should have made them scrapping
mad for the morrow.</p>

<p>The revolution not having materialized, I went to
the cock-fight. It was held in a back yard, where a
rude board shack had been improvised. There was
a dirt-floored ring, surrounded by a four-foot wall,
and overlooked by a rickety grand-stand and a still
more rickety bleachers.</p>

<p>The ring was already thronged with natives, each
holding a rooster in his arms, and shoving it at
another fellow’s rooster in order to provoke the
martial spirit. The birds were fluttering, blinking
beady eyes at other birds, and clucking loudly to
express their irritation. Back against the adobe
rampart of the establishment were some forty other
prospective contestants, each in an individual cage,
crowing noisily as though he would proclaim himself
the father of the largest egg ever laid in Honduras.</p>

<p>There was much delay. It seems that the gentlemen
in the ring were trying to match their birds,
but each desired to pair off his own with one that
could be easily licked. There was much argument,
much waving of hands, much indignant protest. At
length it was settled. A little fat man beside me
commenced sawing off the spurs from a rooster’s
legs, and fitting thereon two sharp curved blades of
steel. At the money counter&mdash;a rough wooden
board presided over by a tall stony-faced man with
heavy black eyebrows and the general air of the
professional gambler&mdash;there was great excitement.
Men crowded about it, shouting, “Two pesos on the
red one!” “One peso on the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gallina</i>!”</p>

<p>The umpire&mdash;a well-dressed, impressive-looking
individual who had once held office in the Honduran
cabinet&mdash;inspected the steel gaffs, and the
fight commenced. The two owners released their
birds, and withdrew. For a moment both cocks eyed
one another. Then, in apparent indifference, they
turned away, and pecked unconcernedly at the
ground, strolling around the ring as though neither
saw the other. They walked clumsily, bothered by
the long blades they carried. Occasionally they
stopped, raised their heads, and crowed. Then they
resumed their pecking at the earth, hunting imaginary
worms. This, however, was all bluff, designed
to throw the adversary off his guard. Quick as a
flash one turned and flew at the other. They met
in mid-air with a great flurry of feathers. Back
they drew, crouching. Then they were at it again,
clawing and pecking until the world became saturated
with flying rooster.</p>

<p>The spectators went frantic with joy. They
screamed applause. They shouted advice at the contestants.</p>

<p>Again the cocks drew back, crouching. A wild
yell went up from the stands. I could observe nothing,
but these fellows were experts, and they saw
the end before it came. For suddenly, without warning,
one of the cocks toppled upon its side, gushing
blood from its trembling beak. In a flash the other
was upon it, pecking triumphantly at its head. And
the crowd poured into the ring.</p>

<p>There were other combats. The intermissions
were long, and marked always with much bickering.
The fight might end in a minute; the intermission
was always at least a half hour. After the roosters
were paired there was delay for the fixing of the
gaffs, delay for the betting, delay while each owner
brought in another cock to peck his fighter into the
proper rage. But these people could tolerate any
delay, especially if it were in the interests of the
national sport. When two cocks did not appear
eager to slaughter themselves to make a Honduran
holiday, the wrathful spectators hurled abuse at
them.</p>

<p>“Cowards! You are worse than hens! <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Carramba!</i>”</p>

<p>But there was only one such pair. The others
were game. They might strut about interminably
in their effort to secure an advantage, but once they
clashed, they fought to the death. Sometimes it came
unexpectedly, with one quick blow of the knife.
Usually one of the birds sank weakly on a severed
leg, <span id="wriggle">yet wriggled valiantly</span> toward the other, only to be
pecked again and again until the whole back of its
neck was a ghastly wound. And two of the contestants&mdash;big
strong birds, with glorious plumage of
many shades, and equipped with long, powerful legs&mdash;hurled
themselves at each other the moment they
were released. They met with a crash, and tumbled
over and over, clawing and biting, and rolling the
length of the arena in an indistinguishable mess of
feathered warrior. The crowd was upon its feet.
Men screamed with joy. And after it was all over
they hugged one another.</p>

<p>The little fat man turned to me:</p>

<p>“How do you like it? <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Muy bonita, verdad?</i> Very
nice, what?”</p>

<p>“Awfully nice.”</p>

<p>“There will be others. We shall fight until dark.”
But I strolled back to the comparative quiet of the
hotel. The Spaniard’s birds had all been defeated,
wherefore he was going home by the usual means of
travel.</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>A week passed, and nothing happened.</p>

<p>Rumors flew thick and fast, however. Every one
discussed the forthcoming revolution as a certainty.
Now and then a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peon</i> would drop casually into the
hotel to inquire in whispers whether the guests had
any ammunition to sell. He never used the word
“ammunition,” but resorted to harmless-sounding
synonyms unintelligible except to the born conspirator.</p>

<p>One noticed that the men of the upper classes
were more democratic than usual. Men of distinguished
appearance would stop in the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i> to
chat with the barefoot rabble whom they ordinarily
passed without recognition. Politicians were now
cultivating good will. They would soon need this
rabble as cannon fodder.</p>

<p>It was said that Carías would start <em>his</em> insurrection
on Christmas Eve. The government, as a precaution
against the assembling of a crowd, forbade
the holding of the usual midnight mass at the
Cathedral. When I spoke English over the telephone
the day before, in conversation with a member
of the American colony, I was interrupted by the
frantic voice of a censor, clamoring that I confine
myself to Spanish, and shortly thereafter a police
official waited upon me and put me through a courteous
third degree.</p>

<p>A later report stated that the government had
taken five hundred prisoners, and that the revolution
was postponed. But an air of expectancy still
hung over the Capital. Christmas Eve&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">La Noche
Buena</i>&mdash;was gloomy. A drizzle of rain fell intermittently.
The street lamps, never very bright in
Tegucigalpa, seemed unusually dim. The sidewalks
were deserted save for patrols of soldiers, who
stopped me at each corner to search for weapons.</p>

<p class="center">SOLDIERS STOPPED A PEDESTRIAN AT EVERY CORNER TO
SEARCH FOR WEAPONS<br /></p>

<p>On the night before, all had been gayety. Over in
Camyaguela, the suburb across the river, there had
been a religious festival&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">la fiesta de la Concepción
la Purísima</i>&mdash;the festival of the Purest Conception.
The Cathedral had been surrounded by improvised
board shacks where booze was sold. At tables in the
open, lighted by flaring torches, there had been roulette
wheels and other gambling devices. There had
been music in the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>, and the belles of the town&mdash;all
with white faces, but with tell-tale arms and
necks varying in color from a creamy tint to a deep
chocolate brown&mdash;had paraded around and around
the park, while the young dandies fairly impaled
themselves on the fence-pickets to watch them.</p>

<p>But to-night gayety stayed indoors. Through the
open windows I could see an occasional tinsel-decked
tree, but more frequently a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">navidad</i>, the old
Spanish Christmas decoration&mdash;a triangular stage
in one corner of the parlor, covered with artificial
grass, with a little cave at the rear, wherein reposed
replicas of Mary and Jesus. Other figures filled the
foreground, according to the family’s resources.
There were the three wise men, mounted on toy
burros. There were tin soldiers and paper soldiers,
cardboard houses, cardboard trees, toy animals, toy
railway trains&mdash;everything imaginable&mdash;until the
humble manger was surrounded by all the creatures
of the zoo and all the inventions of modern civilization.
The whole display was decked with pine-boughs
and thatches of banana leaf. Each family
was very proud of its <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">navidad</i>, and if I paused to indulge
a traveler’s curiosity by staring through the
window&mdash;an impulse quite irresistible in these countries,
where windows open directly upon the street,
and are left unshuttered by a people whose greatest
joy in life is to be looked at&mdash;the family would invite
me inside, that I might examine the display at close
range.</p>

<p>They were quietly happy, these people, yet they
seemed listening always for the first boom of the
cannon. Nothing happened, however. Nothing
ever did happen in Latin America while I was present.
From day to day I had heard what sounded
like the rattle of musketry, and had rushed out to
see the fighting, only to learn that the rattle came
from the ungreased wheels of an ox-cart lumbering
over the rough cobbles.</p>

<p>At the Consul’s Christmas dinner, attended by a
dozen of the leading Americans in town, every one
had had the same experience.</p>

<p>“There was a crowd gathering on the hill to-day,”
some one remarked. “The police came up in a body
and dispersed it.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear the shooting night before last?”
another inquired. “There were several pistol shots,
and then the burst of a machine-gun. I wonder how
soon they will really start?”</p>

<p>But the American Minister, from the seat of honor
at the right of the host, merely smiled.</p>

<p>“There will be no revolution,” he predicted.</p>

<p>“Do you mean the United States will intervene?”</p>

<p>He merely smiled again. Still, I felt that there was
hope. The ox-carts were sounding more and more
like musketry every day.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>Christmas having provided no thrills, Tegucigalpa
looked forward to New Year’s. On that day Congress
was to convene to choose a president. Whoever
was chosen would probably be obliged to fight the
other two candidates.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I hired a mule and rode out to see
the American-owned Rosario mines at San Juancito,
forty kilometers from the capital.</p>

<p>The trail was rugged, but it led through magnificent
scenery, among pine-clad mountains, ascending
a ridge seven thousand feet high, where the
clouds formed a heavy wet blanket yet opened occasionally
to permit a glimpse of wild tropical forest
below.</p>

<p>Most mining properties are situated in barren,
desolate regions. That of the Rosario Company,
the largest silver mine in Central America, is situated
in a glorious valley, and from its neat white
buildings one looks down upon a misty wilderness
that stretches away through countless lower valleys,
with a silver ribbon of water curling through them
toward the sea. Despite its isolation, and the one
rough mule trail that connects the mine with the rest
of the world, it roared with industry. There was a
reverberating chorus of giant crushers, the rattle of
cars on many miles of narrow-gauge track, the crash
of ore-bearing rock dumped into the stamp-mills, the
hum of massive machinery.</p>

<p>“We brought everything out in ox-cart or on muleback,”
said the young-appearing superintendent.
“We now have seventy miles of tunnel, and employ
eight hundred men in Rosario&mdash;thirteen hundred
indirectly. And less than thirty <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i> bosses run
the whole thing. We used to have twice the force,
but we’ve cut it down. There’s efficiency, nowadays,
even forty kilometers from a town in Honduras.
We turned out two million ounces of silver
this year.”</p>

<p>The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i> bosses were quiet, earnest young men,
intent upon their work. There were none of the
roistering adventurers that one looks for in the
wilds of a Honduran jungle. They drank moderately&mdash;very
moderately, it seemed to one who had
worked in an Andean mining camp&mdash;and never carried
revolvers, except when visiting the native town
in the gulch below, which averaged two murders
every Sunday. They spent most of their spare time
in the club room&mdash;a comfortable room with a big
fireplace, pool tables, piano and victrola, and a complete
library.</p>

<p>The camp was at an altitude of five thousand feet.
The night was cold. The blazing fire was agreeable.</p>

<p>“This is the tropics,” said one of them, “and I
have to pay double life insurance rates for living
here, when it’s much more healthy than any place in
the United States.”</p>

<p>The superintendent drew me aside, and led me upstairs
to hear his radio. The blare of jazz was as
clear as though one listened in from New York.</p>

<p>“That’s Vincent Lopez, in the grill-room of the
Pennsylvania. Wait a minute ’til I get Schenectady,
and we’ll have a bed-time story.”</p>

<p>Out here in the wilderness, forty kilometers from
the nearest town, and many hundred miles from a
railway, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i> energy had produced all the comforts
of home. And <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i> industry was furnishing
much of the wealth that flowed into the Honduran
treasury.</p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p>The real mainstay of the Honduran treasury is
the East Coast, where several American fruit companies
own extensive banana plantations.</p>

<p>It has little connection with the rest of the
country. A newly instituted service by airplane
now enables one to reach it from Tegucigalpa in a
couple of days, but unless one can afford this method
of travel, one must go by mule, and the journey takes
about two weeks.</p>

<p>The several <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i> concerns have so developed
the formerly worthless, fever-stricken swamps of
the Caribbean, that to-day it contains almost half
the population of Honduras, and produces eighty-two
per cent. of the country’s revenue, and both
ratios are increasing in favor of the Coast. Nearly
all the revolutions start in this region, partly because
of its isolation from the Capital where the government
holds sway, and partly because in cutting
off the revenue the revolutionists can starve the government
into surrender.</p>

<p>With every revolution&mdash;as in all these countries&mdash;come
rumors that some American company is back
of it, financing a new régime as the cheapest road to
new concessions. The rumors are so recurrent
that some of them are probably true. But the Honduraneans
as a whole are rather fond of insurrection,
whether started by foreigners or by their own
countrymen. Living in a country for the most part
unfertile and unproductive, whose resources can be
developed only by much toil and trouble, they find it
easier to leave constructive work to the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i>,
while they squabble among themselves for control
of the government.</p>


<h3>XII</h3>

<p>January first arrived, and Congress met.</p>

<p>I went to the Capitol with Mario Ribas, who was
the Associated Press Correspondent and the editor
of Tegucigalpa’s leading magazine. He was a Spaniard
and a neutral in politics.</p>

<p>“If any one starts shooting,” he advised, “the
quickest way out of the building is that of sliding
down the shed, running across the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i>, and climbing
over the roof.”</p>

<p>The legislators met in a long, narrow room filled
with plain wooden benches. On the wall were the
pictures of former presidents, almost none of whom
had been able to finish his term before succeeded by
one of the others. The chamber’s only real embellishments
were the many flags and draperies of
blue and white that hung from the ceiling.</p>

<p>At the entrance was a company of boy soldiers
from the military school&mdash;none of them twenty years
of age, but considered the most dependable of the
government troops. Their officers scanned every
one who entered the Capitol, but they knew Ribas,
and passed us without question.</p>

<p>The congressmen assembled gradually, each of
them appearing a trifle nervous. They wore high
hats and Prince Albert coats, but a suspicious bulge
at the hip testified that each was ready for a possible
emergency, and when a coat swung accidentally
open, one caught a glimpse of a well-filled cartridge
belt.</p>

<p>Still, the first day passed without disturbance.
There was a slight row when the august body voted
down a motion to make some trifling alteration to
the minutes of the last meeting. The deputy whose
motion was defeated rose indignantly. With the
amazing sensitiveness of the Latin-American, he felt
that he had been personally insulted. Furiously
he turned and stamped out of Congress, seizing his
hat and cane from the rack outside, and knocking
down the hats of several other deputies in his haste.
They all rushed out, picked up their hats, wiped off
the dust, and hung them up again. Then the meeting
resumed, interrupted by other slight rows, as
other men took offense because their suggestions
were not received enthusiastically, and followed the
exit of the first.</p>

<p>Finally the remaining few sent a committee to
inform the President that they were ready to listen
to his opening message. The cadets formed a double
line from the Palace to the Capitol, and the
President came in person, walking at the head of
the cabinet and the diplomatic corps. He was a
worried-looking little man, and he walked with tired
step. Four bands cheered him with the National
Anthem, all playing in different tempo, a boom of
cannon greeted him from the fortress, and his boy
soldiers presented arms at sixty different angles.
The crowds applauded, and I was reaching into my
pocket for a handkerchief to wave at him, when a
firm hand closed upon my wrist, and I looked into
the hard face of a Honduran secret service man.</p>

<p>“Pardon, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>!” he said, as he saw that I had
only a handkerchief. “One can not be too careful
these days.”</p>

<p>Then the President disappeared into the Capitol
to read his message, and the soldiers barred the
gates to sight-seers.</p>

<p>“There’ll be nothing happening to-day,” said
Ribas. “It takes them a while to get started. Wait
until they meet to-morrow.”</p>


<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>But nothing happened on the morrow, or the day
after that. Congress was still indulging in oratory.
From time to time some one suggested a vote on the
presidential question, but whenever it appeared that
Árias might have enough supporters present to elect
him, the adherents of Carías and Bonilla hastily
seized their high silk hats and rushed outside so that
there would be no quorum.</p>

<p>By this time most of the deputies were wearing
two guns. Rumor stated that one Congressman had
also added to his equipment a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">machete</i>, a sword cane
and a pair of brass knuckles. It began to look as
though <em>he</em> might be able to settle the dispute. Then,
by order of the President, the military stopped each
Congressman at the door and disarmed him. And
the indignant legislators were so incensed that they
refused to meet. The Hall of Congress stood empty.</p>

<p>Rumors flew thick and fast again. Carías had
slipped out of the city last night! He had gone to
the east coast to organize his revolution! No, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>,
he had done nothing of the kind! He had gone to the
west coast. <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Ay</i>, but he had just been seen at his
dwelling in Tegucigalpa, he was still in the city!
Perhaps the revolution would start right here!</p>

<p>There came another night when the outbreak was
expected.</p>

<p>“Do not go out this evening,” urged little Petrona,
as she brought my evening beans to the table.
“You may be killed in the street if you are not careful.”</p>

<p>But my experience in Latin America had taught
me that it is always some one else who is killed there.
Having missed seeing so many insurrections elsewhere,
I felt it a duty to witness this one. And I
wandered through the dim streets, deserted as on
Christmas Eve, and gloomy again with drizzling
rain. The soldiery were again on patrol, searching
me at every half block, even though they had seen
me searched by their cohorts just a few feet away.</p>

<p>No open windows gave me a view to-night of
families gathered about a Christmas tree. Doors
and windows alike were shut and tightly barred.
Not a soul was to be met except the barefoot troops.
Not a light was to be seen except the flickering street
lamp at each corner.</p>

<p>At the leading hotel the door was unlocked, and I
pushed inside. Instead of the usual swarm of native
aristocrats, the only occupants of the café were
the bartender, a bootblack, and three <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringos</i>.
They were Doc, Sparks, and Pop. Doc had the little
bootblack on his knee, feeding him cheese, and
teaching him to sing “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
Sparks was shaking dice with the bartender to
determine which should give the other his hat and go
home bareheaded. Pop had four bottles of whiskey
before him, with which the party was about to adjourn
to his room, and he was covering the back of
an envelope with figures in his effort to determine
how four bottles could be evenly distributed among
three men. Seeing me he threw the pencil in the air.</p>

<p>“Solved!” he cried.</p>

<p>And we adjourned to Pop’s quarters in the second
story of the annex. I had some qualms as to the
advisability of joining, for I dreaded the prospect
of missing the revolution, but the other <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringos</i>
already had reached the stage where refusal of such
an invitation is considered an affront. Arrived in
Pop’s room, they listened to my protest, and overruled
it.</p>

<p>“You don’t need to see a revolution. We’ll tell
you all about everything that happened in the whole
history of Honduras. What do you want first?”</p>

<p>“How about the last revolution?”</p>

<p>Doc, elected raconteur for the three, assumed the
attitude of a high-school declaimer, and announced:</p>

<p>“The last revolution.” He cleared his throat,
and commenced dramatically. “I was standing in
the doorway of the Young Men’s Christian Association&mdash;”</p>

<p>“In the doorway of the Agurcia,” corrected
Sparks.</p>

<p>“Of the Agurcia, when suddenly a machine-gun
started banging down the street, and the bar-room
door went shut behind me, catapulting me into the
middle of the road. I picked myself up, and made
a rush for the W.C.T.U. across the way&mdash;</p>

<p>“For the what?”</p>

<p>“For the establishment across the way, and <em>they</em>
slammed the doors in my face. I made a bee-line
for the Epworth League meeting around the corner,
and the barkeeper there&mdash;”</p>

<p>He paused to pour another round and forgot to
resume. He walked out to the balcony with the
empty bottle and returned with the sorrowful comment,
“Nobody to throw it at. What do you want
to hear about next?”</p>

<p>“Tell him about the badger fight,” suggested Pop.</p>

<p>Pop had stripped off his clothing, and now sat
naked on the bed, a rather slender old gentleman,
whose white hair still gave him something of dignity.
Young Sparks was crawling under the
bureau after the corkscrew. Doc, big and rotund,
with cheerful ruddy face, again took the floor.</p>

<p>“The badger fight. We got the Salvadorean minister
to be the badger’s second. He came direct
from some diplomatic function, wearing his top hat,
and his long coat, and his striped pants, and his
spats, and patent leather shoes. We took him up
to the hill, where we had the badger-cage all padded
with straw. The dog that was to fight the badger
was a big, ugly bloodhound. All the minister had to
do was take hold of the rope, and pull the badger
out of the cage, we explained, only we thought it best
to put a stove-pipe over each of his legs, and cover
his chest with a baseball protector, and put a mask
over his face, and long gauntlets on his arms. You
should have seen him in that get-up, with a silk hat
on top of it all. We gave him the end of the rope,
and said ‘Go!’ He was so scared, he forgot to let
go of the rope, and when we all started yelling down
hill, he beat the whole gang, still dragging behind
him the old slop bucket that was in the badger-cage.
But he was game. He took us all back to town and
bought the&mdash;”</p>

<p>Association of ideas brought Doc’s eye to another
bottle, and he emptied it into the glasses, shampooing
Pop’s white hair with the dregs of it.</p>

<p>“At-a-boy, shampoo it!” chuckled Pop.</p>

<p>And Doc shampooed industriously. “Gimme the
scissors,” he commanded. “Don’t cut it off!” protested
Sparks. But Pop was game. <span id="cut">“Cut it all</span>
off!” he cried recklessly. The party was getting
rough. Sparks seized an armful of bottles and commenced
hurling them from the balcony. They
crashed noisily upon the silent street. Pop seized a
paper bag, blew it up, and smote it with a loud,
“Bang!”</p>

<p>If I were ever going to see the revolution, it was
time to make my exit. I ducked out quietly, strolled
downstairs and around the corner, and reached the
avenue just in time to hear the excitement. A volley
of musketry sounded from the barracks a few blocks
away. Policemen were blowing their whistles, and
running up and down. I chased after one.</p>

<p>“Where is it?” I demanded.</p>

<p>He was too busy blowing his whistle to answer me.
More policemen joined us, and we ran toward the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>, colliding with another patrol running from
the opposite direction. Here or there a scattering
shot resounded, but one could not judge its source.
We raced around corners, up and down the street,
asking other parties where the trouble was to be
found, but no one knew. At length the shooting subsided,
and I went home to bed.</p>

<p>The next morning I made inquiries.</p>

<p>“There was no revolution, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>! Only a couple
of drunken <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Americanos</i> blowing up paper bags and
smashing bottles!”</p>


<h3>XIV</h3>

<p>Tegucigalpa was quiet again.</p>

<p>The American Minister drove past my hotel in a
big automobile filled with American naval officers in
gold braid and cocked hats. The warship <i>Rochester</i>,
flag-ship of the Panama squadron, was now anchored
off Amapala. Admiral Dayton had come up to the
Capital with his staff on what was described officially
as “nothing more than a courtesy visit.” But it was
reported that American gunboats were now lying off
the east coast ports, ready to protect American
property at the banana plantations. And it was
humorously said in Tegucigalpa that the Admiral
was about to reconvene Congress and preside over it
himself.</p>

<p class="center space-above"><span class="figcenter" id="i_031">
  <img src="images/031.jpg" class="w75"  alt="THE WARSHIP ROCHESTER HAD ANCHORED AT AMAPALA ON WHAT

</span></p>
<p class="center">THE WARSHIP ROCHESTER HAD ANCHORED AT AMAPALA ON WHAT
WAS DESCRIBED AS A COURTESY VISIT<br /></p>

<p>“There will be much speculation regarding this
visit,” suggested an American at the Legation.</p>

<p>The Minister smiled.</p>

<p>“I think there will be no speculation at all.”</p>

<p>Honduras apparently had taken the hint. Just
how the election difficulties were to be solved, no one
knew, but every one agreed that they would be solved
peacefully. Wherefore I caught the daily passenger
truck down to Amapala to continue my journey to
Nicaragua.</p>

<p>But, as always in these countries, the unexpected
happened. The American warship, as soon as peace
had settled upon Honduras, steamed away. And a
few days later the whole Republic was in flames.
Cable dispatches informed the world that Carías had
slipped out of Tegucigalpa, joined forces awaiting
him near the Nicaraguan border, and started back
to the capital, that President Gutierrez had fled to
Amapala and died there from nervous strain, that
the other candidates were leading troops in other
sections of the country, that machine-guns were
sweeping the streets of the cities, that American
citizens were taking refuge in the Legation, that the
Rosario mines were calling for protection, and that
American marines were landing at the banana plantations
of the East Coast.</p>

<p>Such is life in Honduras!</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>To journey from one Central-American republic
to another, the traveler should equip
himself with a private yacht.</p>

<p>Having neglected this precaution, he must resort
to patience. There is a steamship service along the
Pacific Coast which advertises regular sailing dates.
But since its vessels are quite apt to be ahead of
their schedules, one usually repairs to the seaport a
day or two in advance. And since they are far more
apt to be behind their schedules, one usually waits
there for a period varying from one to three weeks,
at a shabby hotel in a blazing hot town whose inhabitants
earn their living by overcharging such
travelers as fate has thus thrown into their grasp.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Not possessing the private yacht, I left Tegucigalpa
for Amapala one day in advance.</p>

<p>Bill, the hard-boiled, took me down the mountain
road to San Lorenzo, where a launch was already
waiting. There a member of the crew undertook to
facilitate my voyage. He greeted me with a smile
as I reached the end of the wharf.</p>

<p>“I’m the man who carried your suit-case, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>.”</p>

<p>“I carried it myself.”</p>

<p>“Did you really? Then I’ll put it on board for
you.”</p>

<p>Since a squad of Honduran soldiers held all
passengers on the wharf until the baggage was
aboard, I surrendered it to him, and he placed it on
the extreme edge of the stern, precariously balanced
on the small end, tying it fast with the rest of the
cargo, but with a flimsy piece of cord which threatened
at any moment to break and spill the entire
load into the Gulf of Fonseca.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” he assured me. “I have my eye
on it!”</p>

<p>Then, as the soldiers finally permitted us to embark&mdash;after
an official had ascertained that my passport
was properly viséd by the Honduran Minister
of Foreign Relations&mdash;the officious <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mozo</i>
climbed upon the thwarts to offer me an unnecessary
hand. “When we arrived at Amapala, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>, I’ll
show you to the hotel.”</p>

<p>“I already know one hotel there.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll show you to the other one.”</p>

<p>I had frequently encountered his type in nearly
every port of the world. He believed all traveling
Yankees to be simpletons with the one redeeming
virtue of lavishness in bestowing tips for useless
services. Throughout the four-hour ride across the
Gulf, he sat opposite me, smiling sweetly whenever
he could catch my attention. And when we drew
up beside the wharf at Amapala, he untied my suit-case
first. But having untied it, he left it while he
assisted the rest of the crew in dragging eight heavy
trunks up a slippery flight of wooden steps.</p>

<p>According to local custom, another squad of soldiers
herded all passengers ashore to answer another
questionnaire, and from the dock I looked down to
see my suit-case dancing and rocking unsteadily with
each swell that rolled in from the misnamed Pacific.
From the opposite end of the launch, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mozo</i> held
up his palm in the Latin-American gesture that signifies,
“Patience.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">No hay cuidado, señor.</i> I’m watching it.”</p>

<p>But it was already toppling. And the shadowy
figure of a shark, cruising about the murky waters
below, suggested the impracticability of recovering
it later by diving. Avoiding the guard, I landed
back on the launch, and caught the suit-case just as it
started to fall. Four ragged urchins, waiting on the
dock to carry baggage, leaped after me to struggle
for its possession. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mozo</i> joined the fray. We
surged back and forth across the deck, while the
shark waited below, until our battle was interrupted
by a policeman with drawn revolver.</p>

<p>“You are arrested!” he screamed at me.</p>

<p>And he marched me to the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">commandancia</i>, where
a pompous official lectured me, politely but firmly,
upon the insult I had paid the government of Honduras.
It was a small country, he said, but it possessed
high ideals. The authority of its army was a
thing to be respected. Considering that I was a
foreigner and not acquainted with local customs, I
would be forgiven. But in the future, he hoped I
should never jump off a dock onto a boat until all
cargo was unloaded.</p>

<p>As I walked out of the office, still clinging to my
suit-case, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mozo</i> came up to demand his tip for
keeping an eye on it. I waited a moment to see how
much the policeman would expect for his services in
arresting me, but he collected only the customary fee
which all passengers paid for the use of the wharf in
disembarking.</p>

<p>So I turned toward the steamship office, to learn
when I might proceed to Nicaragua.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Quién sabe?</i> We expected two passenger vessels.
But the one, last night at La Unión, went back
to La Libertad for six more sacks of coffee. And
the other, having filled with coffee at San José de
Guatemala, has canceled its schedule entirely.”</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>I stopped at the leading hotel, operated&mdash;like
most hotels on this coast&mdash;by a Chinaman.</p>

<p>It was the usual type of seaport hostelry, less
comfortable and more expensive than those of the
interior cities, but well stocked with fleas, bugs,
liquor, and flirtatious servant maids.</p>

<p>“What does one do in this town for amusement?”
I asked a native.</p>

<p>“Amusement?” He seemed a little surprised.
“Why, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>, there are <em>plenty</em> of women.”</p>

<p>For occupation, the male population carried the
baggage of passing travelers. The female population
took in washing. Rather dark, and not distinguished
for beauty, the younger ones called at the
hotel for the laundry; the older ones did the work.
They took the clothes to the waterfront, laid the
garments on flat rocks, and pounded the buttons off
with a stout club. Then they left them to bleach,
spreading them out on scrubby little bushes whose
berries stained them with yellow spots, while they
themselves&mdash;already stripped to the waist for comfort&mdash;retired
to the shallow water to immerse themselves
through the hot mid-day. In the evening they
collected the garments, carried them home, and
ripped them into shreds with rusty irons. Finally,
having wrapped them into a neat bundle with the
least-ruined articles on top, the younger girls
brought them back with smiling countenances, and
the inquiry:</p>

<p>“Is that all, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>?”</p>

<p>As a town, Amapala was not unpicturesque. Its
whitewashed houses, beneath red-tiled roofs, were
set amid palms and bougainvillea. If at noon it
seemed to wither under the dry white heat of a
tropic sun, there was usually a breeze in the evening,
with a tang of salt from the ocean. Across the Gulf
of Fonseca, if one looked beyond the fleet of scows
and lighters in the foreground, one could see myriad
islands and the cones of several Salvadorean volcanoes.
There was a play of red and gold at sunset,
then the purple and silver of twilight, and finally a
glorious night with stars twinkling above and fireflies
below, and the glare of the volcanoes tracing a
crimson path through the waters of the bay.</p>

<p>Its only point of interest, however, was the cliff
where occurred a bloody incident in a long-past war
between Nicaragua and Honduras. Some many
years ago Nicaragua, having confiscated a smuggling
schooner, had armed it with a cannon, and
feeling rather cocky in its possession of a navy,
had dispatched it to fight Honduras. It came up to
Amapala and fired one shot. The bloody incident
occurred when a Honduranean, standing on the cliff,
craned his neck to see where the shot landed, and fell
into the Gulf of Fonseca.</p>

<p>From the cone of the extinct volcano that rose
above Amapala, one could see Honduras, Salvador,
and Nicaragua. Each was but a few hours’ distance
from the other, yet the traveler might wait indefinitely
for a boat. Shields, my companion on the auto
trip from Guatemala to Santa Ana, was now in
Amapala, also bound for Nicaragua, and had already
been waiting over a week.</p>

<p>He spent most of his time on the hotel veranda,
scanning the horizon with a telescope. This operation
afforded much entertainment for the village
idiot. Each Central-American port seems to contain
one weak-minded or defective youth, who sits all day
at the hotel to watch the every movement of a visiting
foreigner. In Amapala it was “The Dummy.”</p>

<p>He was a harmless, pleasant little brown fellow
in ragged breeches and an undershirt salvaged from
the rubbish pile. How he lived, no one seemed able
to explain. Some one apparently fed him. No one
apparently washed him. Occasionally he earned a
few pennies by performing tricks for tourists. His
chief accomplishment was that of resting his bare
toe upon a lighted cigarette. He was always cheerful,
and affable, and he would chat with us by the
hour in parrot-like squawks made intelligible by a
marvelous art of mimicry. He could describe any
one in Amapala by a single gesture. For the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Commandante</i>
he twisted an imaginary mustache. For
the Chinaman, he pulled down his cheeks to give his
eyes an oblique slant. He became our constant associate
and entertainer, guide, counselor and friend.</p>

<p>From time to time, as an alternative amusement,
Shields wrote passionate love letters to the daughters
of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Commandante</i>&mdash;the only two white girls
in town&mdash;to which missives, I later learned, he usually
signed my name. The Dummy would serve as
emissary, and upon his return would enact the giggling
of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señoritas</i>, and the wrathful explosions
of their parents.</p>

<p>Toward evening, the two girls sometimes made
their appearance to stroll in the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>, accompanied
by a male relative with a rifle. Occasionally they
would stop at the hotel for a glass of lemonade, and
would subject Shields and myself to the careful
scrutiny to which <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señoritas</i> invariably subject a
strange youth, while their companion sat beside
them with the rifle over his knees. Still later the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Commandante</i> himself would join them, favoring us
with a stern military glance of warning.</p>

<p>The Dummy always sidled away at his approach,
for the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Commandante</i> had arrested him not long ago.
He often told us the story in his own crude language.
The trouble had been about a woman. From his
ecstatic expression, she must have been beautiful.
He would point at his face, then at his black trousers,
to suggest her complexion, and a twist of his
fingers would indicate kinky hair. He showed us in
pantomime the evil intentions of a rival. He seized
a rock and planted it with much zest against the
villain’s imaginary skull. He whistled shrilly. That
was a policeman! He slumped into a heap as the
imaginary club descended upon his head. He placed
his wrists together. Handcuffed! He held up ten
fingers. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Commandante</i> had sentenced him to
ten days! Then he gave a series of unintelligible
parrot-squawks, and pointed toward La Unión.
During his imprisonment, the girl had fled with the
rival! He shook his head sadly, and ran a hand
across his throat. Was he meditating suicide? Or
was he planning revenge? His story always ended
in the harsh, mirthless laughter of an imbecile, and
he sidled away, for the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Commandante</i>, having partaken
of his cocktail, was leading his family home.</p>

<p>In the evening the Consular Agent, fat and jovial,
would drop in for a glass of beer. His only official
duty at present was looking after a Panamanian
sailor who had fallen down the hold of the last vessel
in port and broken a shoulder bone.</p>

<p>“It might have killed a white man, but you can’t
hurt these natives. Down in Nicaragua, I saw one
fellow sink a pen-knife two inches into another
fellow’s skull. We just pulled it out, and the man
went on working.”</p>

<p>And many other yarns would follow, the locale
varying from Chile, where they use those little
curved blades with an upward thrust, to the Philippines,
where the Moros take your head off with one
deft swing of a bolo. We would all collaborate, the
stories growing more and more astounding until we
reached the incident of the Mexican who swam two
miles after a shark had bitten off his stomach.</p>

<p>“I believe it,” the Consular Agent would nod.
“Down in Costa Rica a shark bit one of my pearl-divers,
and took out a chunk as big as a watermelon.
We clapped it back on, plastered the edges with a
little mud&mdash;”</p>

<p>Then we would have another beer, and the Consular
Agent would stroll homeward. The street
lamps flickered. Five ragged soldiers&mdash;the night
patrol&mdash;glided past us like phantoms through the
dark street. A <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peon</i> girl hurried along the sidewalk,
and the Dummy, bidding us good-night, ran after
her with shrill parrot-like squawks. Within the
hotel the Chinaman sat imperturbable as a Buddha,
waiting to close up his establishment, while the
town’s three German merchants drowsed at a table.</p>

<p>Shields and I would rise and yawn.</p>

<p>“To-morrow there may be a boat.”</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The one break in the day’s monotony came at mid-afternoon.</p>

<p>Then a shore-party from the <i>Rochester</i>, still lingering
far out in the harbor, would shoot past the
waterfront in a trim white launch, and come rolling
up the long wharf to see the sights of town.</p>

<p>Whenever the Chinaman saw them coming, he
would shout for all his servants to man the bar.</p>

<p>The sailors, seeming to know the local geography
instinctively, headed straight for the hotel. While
their Ship’s Police scattered out through town with
swinging clubs, the tars all trooped into the establishment.</p>

<p>“Hello there, buddy! Say, kin you talk this spig
language? Tell that Chink we want liquor!”</p>

<p>And presently they were all over the city, bargaining
in every shop, contriving somehow despite
their ignorance of Spanish to obtain whatever they
desired. They purchased native rope bags, and
filled them with fresh eggs, live turtles, earthenware
jars, Spanish daggers, goat-skulls, fruits, vegetables,
and snake skins. They stood on street corners,
frowning over handfuls of unfamiliar coins received
in exchange, wondering to what extent they had been
cheated.</p>

<p>“Hey there, feller. You’re a Yank, ain’t you?
Tell me how much I’ve got here in <em>real</em> money.”</p>

<p>One husky tar, with a sailor’s knack of getting acquainted,
rolled up the street with a native girl on
his arm, amid the cheers of his friends. He had a
sandwich in one hand, and a flask in the other. She
was a chubby little brown creature, in a tight-fitting
red dress, and her short fat legs bulged above the
tops of high, tightly-laced boots that appeared newly
purchased.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, sister. We’re goin’ in here an’
get you a hat. You’ll be some swell skoit when I
get finished wit’ you.”</p>

<p>They vanished into a shop. When they emerged,
the lady wore a green and yellow bonnet trimmed
with purple and blue. She was leading her hero toward
the village photographer’s to immortalize in
tin-type this thrilling event. They came out with
the photographer’s parrot. The sailor had purchased
it, and was teaching it to say:</p>

<p>“To hell wit’ the marines!”</p>

<p>Gradually, as the hour of departure drew near,
all would gravitate toward the saloon at the wharf,
where they purchased more flasks of whiskey for the
journey to their ship. The little native bartender,
overwhelmed at the many orders shouted at him
in a strange tongue, became completely paralyzed,
whereupon every one helped himself, and tossed
greenbacks across the bar. At last the S.P.’s commenced
to herd the crowd toward their launch. A
delinquent always came running from town at the
last moment, his bag of eggs bouncing against his
uniform and creating golden havoc. The little native
bartender came to life to scream that two flasks had
not been paid for. The escort of the lady in the red
dress had a fight at the end of the wharf with several
of his cronies who considered it their privilege to
kiss her farewell.</p>

<p>“Act like gentlemen, you &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, or I’ll
poke you one in the snout!”</p>

<p>Then, packed into their trim white craft, they
were gone, leaving Amapala flooded with crisp new
American greenbacks.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Our steamer finally came.</p>

<p>After our two weeks of waiting, it picked us up
and landed us within eight hours at the Nicaraguan
port of Corinto.</p>

<p>For years Nicaragua had been the especial protégé
of the United States government, financed by
American bankers, and policed by American marines.
Having traveled for several months in republics
not blessed with such attentions, a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i>
naturally looked forward to the progressiveness and
modernity of Nicaragua.</p>

<p>No difference was evident.</p>

<p>We landed at a fairly good dock, and sat there for
three hours while the American-supervised customs
officials finished their <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">siesta</i>. Then we passed into
such a town as might have formed the locale of O.
Henry’s “Cabbages and Kings.”</p>

<p>The unpaved streets were grown with grass,
neatly cropped by grazing herds of livestock. The
buildings were mostly flimsy wooden structures
sadly in need of paint. There was nothing to distinguish
Corinto&mdash;the principal seaport of Nicaragua&mdash;from
any other port along the Central-American
coast.</p>

<p>A railway&mdash;one of the American-managed institutions&mdash;carried
me inland through a scraggly jungle.
The country was comparatively level; occasional
volcanic peaks, rising abruptly from the plain, had
rendered it fertile with their lava dust; frequent
lakes indicated a plentiful water supply. Yet one
observed few of the rich plantations that covered
such land in the other Central-American republics;
occasionally there was a field of pineapples or sugar-cane;
as a rule, the road led through wilderness.</p>

<p>León, the second city of Nicaragua, lay thick in
dust. Its streets were unpaved. Its houses, of
brilliant green or yellow, with trimmings of blue and
red, were resplendent in the blinding tropic sunlight,
but upon close inspection, they proved somewhat
dilapidated. Its cathedral towers, rising at every
corner, were cracked and ridden from earthquake
and revolution. The whole town seemed very old
and very sleepy, and drowsing in the memories of a
past. The American occupation had brought an
end to civil strife on a large scale, but it evidently
had not brought the prosperity to mend its ravages.</p>

<p class="center space-above"><span class="figcenter" id="i_032">

DUSTY STREETS SUGGESTED NO PROSPERITY" />
</span></p>
<p class="center">THE AMERICAN INTERVENTION HAD BROUGHT PEACE, BUT MANAGUA’S
DUSTY STREETS SUGGESTED NO PROSPERITY<br /></p>

<p>Managua, the capital, was in no better repair. It
was situated at an altitude of only 140 feet&mdash;by far
the lowest altitude of any Central-American capital.
It sweltered in heat, relieved somewhat by the
breezes from its lakefront, but like Corinto and León
it was a city of sand, and the breezes filled the streets
with swirling dust. Each lumbering ox-cart left a
cloud in its wake. It lay two inches deep on the
main avenues. It covered the grassless <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>, and
the barren expanse of desert before the old cathedral,
where vegetation was sprouting from a fallen
spire. It settled upon the low roofs of the drab
shops and dwellings. It seeped inside through door
or window, and formed a coating upon the tiled floor
of the hotel. Now and then a civic employee would
turn a hose upon some portion of the Sahara, to convert
it momentarily to mud, but no sooner did he
cease than the blazing sun reconverted it to sand,
and the breezes sent it whirling again.</p>

<p>Nicaragua was a country of many natural advantages.
Its people appeared to be of better caliber
than those of Honduras. Its area&mdash;49,200 square
miles&mdash;was the greatest in Central America. Its
land was all suitable for cultivation. Its potential
wealth&mdash;in mahogany and hardwoods, in gold and
silver and other metals&mdash;is estimated by many authorities
to exceed that of any of its neighbors. Yet
the imports and exports of this largest republic were
far below those of Salvador, the smallest. Its cities&mdash;although
upon closer inspection, they proved to
contain better shops and hotels&mdash;were outwardly
less imposing than those of Honduras. And when
I offered a merchant a ten-dollar bill, he threw up
his hands with the exclamation:</p>

<p>“You must change your large money at the
bank!”</p>

<p>I turned to an Old-Timer, himself an American.</p>

<p>“Hasn’t our country done anything to make this
a regular republic?”</p>

<p>“Son,” he said, “this <em>was</em> a regular republic before
our country stepped in.”</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The story of the American coöperation&mdash;which the
Nicaraguans themselves describe by a less pleasant
word&mdash;dates back to 1909.</p>

<p>At that time Nicaragua had a Dictator. José Santos
Zelaya had been reëlecting himself president for
seventeen years. He had commenced his reign, stern
though it was, with fairness and justice toward his
countrymen and friendliness toward foreigners. In
his later years, overwhelmed with conceit at his success,
he came to regard his Dictatorship as a right
that carried with it the privilege to amuse himself as
he saw fit. If he needed money, he horsewhipped
the wealthier merchants until they offered a “voluntary”
contribution. If he saw a woman he desired,
he sent for her to come to the palace. Presently he
commenced to meddle in his neighbor’s affairs,
fomenting revolutions in the adjoining countries,
and thumbing his nose at the United States.</p>

<p>In 1909 a revolution started in his own country,
over at the isolated port of Bluefields on the Caribbean
coast. There are rumors that it had the backing
of American capitalists. These rumors arise
from the fact that Adolfo Diaz, then the treasurer
of the revolution&mdash;and later the leading actor in the
drama&mdash;was an humble employee of an American
concern. Diaz denies these rumors. “Every
penny,” he told me in Managua, “was contributed
by Nicaraguans.” But certain it is that the revolution
had the sympathy of the United States government.</p>

<p>President Taft, at the time, frankly described
Zelaya in a message to Congress as “an international
nuisance.” And when, during the fighting,
the Zelayistas executed two American soldiers of fortune
caught red-handed attempting to dynamite
troopships on the San Juan River, the American
government made this trivial incident the pretext
for hinting broadly that it was time for Zelaya to
resign. Zelaya did resign, leaving the presidency
in the hands of an excellent man backed by all the
old lieutenants of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Zelayista</i> party. The United
States was not satisfied. And when the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Zelayistas</i>,
having licked the revolutionists to a frazzle, were
about to take their stronghold at Bluefields, an
American gunboat intervened on the ground that
further fighting might destroy American property.</p>

<p>From some mysterious source&mdash;which all Latin
America believes to be the United States&mdash;the revolutionists
obtained new ammunition. They sallied
out from Bluefields again, thrashed the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Zelayistas</i>,
and overturned the government. One General Estrada,
the leader of the insurrection, became president,
but he soon gave way to Adolfo Diaz. Now
enters upon the scene the American banker.</p>

<p>President Diaz found the country bankrupt.
There is much controversy as to how the debt originated,
each party blaming it on the other. The
truth is that Zelaya had left several millions in the
treasury because he had just negotiated a loan with
British bankers and had not had time to spend it.
He also left a long list of claims because of his high-handed
confiscation of property. The revolutionists
had doubled the bill by their own destruction of
property during the warfare. Wherefore blame
is divided. The important fact is that Don Adolfo
found his country in debt to the extent of over
thirty-two million dollars, a staggering sum to a
small republic. He called upon a firm of New York
bankers for a loan of fifteen million.</p>

<p>This transaction was arranged through the
American State Department by a treaty which the
Senate&mdash;newly turned democratic when Wilson replaced
Taft&mdash;refused to ratify. Nicaragua, however,
regarded it as an agreement. As security for
the loan, the bankers took over the collection of the
customs, and arranged to look after the whole business
of the national debt. They never advanced the
loan. They did advance a million and a half, followed
by comparatively trifling sums, to stabilize
the currency and reorganize the national bank, but
they also took over the bank. Later, when another
million was advanced, they took over the operation
of the Nicaraguan railway.</p>

<p>President Diaz, now retired to civil life, assumes
full responsibility for these transactions. He is a
pleasant little gentleman with graying hair and a
frank, boyish smile.</p>

<p>“I asked the bankers to do it. I was taking the
only means I had to bring my country out of financial
chaos. But I became, as a result, the most
hated man in Nicaragua.”</p>

<p>In fact, all Nicaragua called him a traitor, accused
him of selling the republic to the American capitalists,
and rose to overthrow him. For three days,
in 1912, the rest of the country poured cannon balls
into Managua, until President Diaz asked the United
States for protection. Two thousand American
marines were promptly landed. Having suppressed
the revolution, they left a “legation guard” in Managua
as an intimation that the United States stood
ready to suppress any further uprisings.</p>

<p>Indirectly these marines make presidents to-day.</p>

<p>Elections in Nicaragua are as much a farce as in
Mexico. Whoever controls the polls wins the verdict.
Wherefore the Conservative party, which first
invited the American bankers, has remained steadily
in power. It can be defeated only by revolution,
which the marines prevent.</p>

<p>“You ought to be here at election time,” said an
old American resident, “and see them run their voters
from one booth to another by the truckload. They
number about one-tenth of the population, but they
always win.”</p>

<p>If the marines were withdrawn&mdash;even the Conservatives
themselves admitted to me&mdash;the present government
would be overthrown within twenty-four
hours. Nicaragua, as a whole, never endorsed the
invitation to the American capitalists. When the
Conservatives invited them, the entire country
turned Liberal. If Zelaya were to come to life and
return to Managua, he would find the republic waiting
with open arms. But while the marines are
present, the Liberals are helpless.</p>

<p class="center space-above"><span class="figcenter" id="i_033">
  <img src="images/033.jpg" class="w75"  alt="IF THE AMERICAN MARINES WERE WITHDRAWN FROM NICARAGUA A
REVOLUTION WOULD TRANSPIRE OVER-NIGHT" />
</span></p>
<p class="center">IF THE AMERICAN MARINES WERE WITHDRAWN FROM NICARAGUA A
REVOLUTION WOULD TRANSPIRE OVER-NIGHT<br /></p>

<p>At the time of my visit another election campaign
was starting. Realizing their dependence upon
Washington, the Liberals had affected a change of
heart, announcing that they would support the bankers
as ardently as the Conservatives, and asking for
a new election law which would keep their opponents
from stuffing the ballot boxes. A new law had been
drafted by a New York lawyer. The Liberals were
hopeful, but uncertain.</p>

<p>“Who will be your candidate?” I asked one of
their leaders.</p>

<p>“We do not know yet,” he said. “We have not
heard who will be most acceptable to Washington.”</p>

<p>During my several weeks in Managua, I talked
with most of the actors who had played leading rôles
in the international drama. I do not believe that the
United States was guilty of a deep-laid plot to gain
possession of the little republic. I believe that the
American government acted for the best interests of
the Nicaraguans. But when one reviews the train
of events since 1909, one sees at a glance that they
can very easily be misinterpreted until they look decidedly
nasty. First came a revolution, assisted by
an American gunboat, which doubled the already-overwhelming
national debt. Then came American
bankers, taking charge of the national debt, and
exacting as security everything of value in the republic.
Then came the American marines, keeping
in power the minority party that invited the bankers,
against the will of Nicaragua itself. And all
Latin America chooses to regard these events as
part of a deep-laid program of intrigue.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>There are always two sides to a question.</p>

<p>Nicaragua, under American supervision, has
made progress, but it is a progress which, both to
the permanent resident and the casual tourist, is
altogether invisible.</p>

<p>Outwardly, since the coming of the bankers, the
republic has marked time. No large industries have
been introduced. No railways have been built. The
greater part of the country is without means of communication
or development. The cities are in worse
repair than those of Honduras. And, although the
bankers deny it, every Nicaraguan&mdash;and nearly
every foreign resident&mdash;proclaims that the country
is far less prosperous to-day than in the worst days
of Zelaya.</p>

<p>This is largely due to the fact that the bankers
administering Nicaragua’s finances are devoting all
their attention to clearing up the old national debt.</p>

<p>Colonel Clifford D. Ham, the American collector
of customs, has reduced this debt from over thirty-two
million dollars to less than nine million. There
is no country in the world, except the United States,
whose finances are to-day in such flourishing condition
as those of Nicaragua. But this means nothing
to the average native. No Latin-American is ever
roused individually to a high pitch of enthusiasm
over the prospect of paying what he owes. Collectively
he finds the idea quite objectionable, particularly
when the indebtedness was contracted a
long time ago. And so he says, “These Americans
turn aside at our very gates every penny that would
otherwise flow into the country; they are draining
the very life-blood from the nation!” He points to
the fact that when the American government, a few
years ago, purchased the rights to build a Nicaraguan
Canal at some time in the future, and paid
therefor three million dollars, the money never left
New York, but was applied immediately upon that
infernal debt.</p>

<p>The national bank has stabilized the currency, so
that the Nicaraguan <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cordoba</i> is on a par with the
American dollar. According to the bankers there is
more money in circulation to-day in Nicaragua than
ever before. But the Nicaraguan insists that prices
have risen so that he now can buy only half as much
as in the days of Zelaya, forgetting that prices have
risen throughout the world. “All the money is in
the bank, and I can not obtain credit without giving
security!” The Latin is not a hard, cold business
man; he resents these business-like methods; he
curses the commerciality of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i>.</p>

<p>The railway, when the Americans took it over,
was a total wreck. The employees had not been paid
for two weeks, since there was just $2.49 in the cash-drawer.
The names of thirty-five dead men were
found still on the payroll. Some of the locomotive
engineers were barefoot. Most of the workers had
to draw their salary in the form of an I.O.U., which
could be cashed at a twenty per cent. discount at the
office of a local pawnbroker. Every one of any
political prominence expected a pass; the more influential
were accustomed to private cars, or to the
courtesy of having the regular passenger train stop
to wait several hours for them while they paid visits
along the line. To-day the road is in good shape;
it operates systematically as railways should operate;
it operates also at a profit instead of a deficit,
and is earning money which is steadily rebuying itself
back into the hands of the Nicaraguan government.
But the Nicaraguan is suspicious. Whenever
the American manager buys a new locomotive,
the newspapers proclaim that he has done so to run
up the bills in order that Nicaragua can not regain
control of the road.</p>

<p>Some day in the near future the American capitalist
will retire, leaving Nicaragua in excellent
shape for progress.</p>

<p>Since the Latin-American lives completely in the
present, the Nicaraguan can not appreciate work
that builds for future prosperity. He sees no visible
result of the American coöperation. He knows only
that his country has been at a standstill since the
Americans came. He loudly damns the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i>. And
all Latin America echoes his accusations against the
scheming Colossus of the North. So, unfortunately,
does many an American resident in Nicaragua.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Nicaragua is a lowland of tropical heat. It has
the least invigorating climate in Central America.
The natives are not particularly blessed with energy
or industry, and are consequently rather eager to
blame their lack of initiative to the stifling effect of
their subserviency to the United States.</p>

<p>Individually they are quite ready to be friendly
to any American. Collectively they love to damn the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringos</i>. And the newspapers of Managua and
León cater regularly to their taste by soaking every
Yankee who attains prominence in the republic.</p>

<p>These papers, like the dailies of Guatemala, are
mostly four-sheet publications with the flavor of
rural journalism. They are printed, usually at a
loss, by gentlemen of political aspirations who desire
an organ for self-expression. The reporters,
inspired by the same vanity, editorialize in every
news report. In mentioning the arrival of an
actress, they felicitate her and wish her success. In
describing the arrest of some petty criminal, they
express the hope that he may be convicted and
hanged and dealt with not too leniently in purgatory.
In attacking Americans, however, they reach
their highest flights of eloquence. No article on
politics or finance is complete without an allusion to
“the oppressive hand of the American banker.”
And when the banker has been exhausted as a source
of indignant outpourings, they give their attention
to the other American residents.</p>

<p>On one occasion they flamed out against young
René Wallace, the son of a Yankee merchant, because
he had organized a league of basket-ball clubs
among the young ladies of Nicaraguan society.
They proclaimed indignantly that he was trying to
deprive the local <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señoritas</i> of all modesty and gentleness
by arraying them in bloomers and teaching
them the hoydenish games wherein no self-respecting
woman could indulge.</p>

<p>On another occasion they flamed out against Dr.
Daniel M. Molloy, of the Rockefeller Foundation,
because the name of Rockefeller suggested to them
another capitalistic invasion. This Foundation has
been active throughout Central America, particularly
in combating hook-worm, wherewith nearly all
the barefoot inhabitants are infected. It suppressed
a yellow fever epidemic which swept throughout
these countries in 1918. It has built hospitals, improved
water supplies, taught hygiene, and worked
in many other ways for the betterment of the various
republics. The ignorant <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peons</i>, indifferent to
hygiene, had always regarded sickness and disease
as something inevitable, to be accepted with fatalistic
patience. In infant mortality, Mexico surpasses
all the world’s civilized communities, while
its total death-rate is thrice that of the United States,
and it is safe to assume that the Central-American
republics&mdash;in the absence of statistics&mdash;keep pace
with Mexico. The educated classes have never made
much effort to relieve this situation. In Tegucigalpa
a recently appointed director of a government hospital
had to begin his work by removing forty-two
cans of garbage left in the hospital <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i> by the last
director. The Rockefeller Foundation there, in employing
a new native physician of high standing in
the community, discovered that he had never studied
bacteriology and had but a vague idea that any
diseases were caused by germs. In lands where
such conditions prevail, the Foundation should
have been hailed as a God-send, especially since it
came largely at its own expense. But a newspaper
in León published daily editorials attacking Dr.
Molloy, and insisting that Rockefeller would presently
be demanding oil concessions. When no such
demands were forthcoming, the editor found another
argument in the fact that Dr. Molloy was advocating
new methods in sewerage disposal.</p>

<p>“Aha!” he shouted on his front page. “We see
the nigger in the woodpile. This <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i> is a secret
representative of a manufacturing firm that hopes
to sell us American plumbing devices!”</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>At the time of my sojourn in Managua, there was
a temporary lull in such attacks, for the city was
indulging in its semi-annual outburst of culture.</p>

<p>The aristocrats of Central America are very fond
of theatrical entertainment, and some of the republics
have built national theaters, but such is the expense
of bringing <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">artistes</i> from Europe that performances
are rare, and usually subsidized by the government.</p>

<p>Frijolita, who had danced before all the crowned
heads of Europe, had recently been performing in
Tegucigalpa. The Honduran government, having
paid her expenses to the country, had allowed
her to get out as best she could, wherefore she was
now about to dance in the neighboring capitals.
All Nicaragua felt honored. Every poet in the
country tuned his lyre, and prepared to sing her
praises.</p>

<p>In Central America nearly every one who can
write is a poet. The composition of verses is a universal
indoor sport among the young men. On Sunday
each newspaper devotes a page to the unremunerated
labors of the local bards. Guests at the
hotels, seeing me scribbling in a note book, always
inquired whether I were writing verses. Every one
who can afford the luxury, prints privately his musings,
which no one else ever seems to read. When it
became known that Frijolita would dance, the editors
themselves took a crack at versification, and
published their outpourings neatly boxed on the first
sheet.</p>

<p>I shared my hotel room with Bosco, the tenor, and
Maestro, the orchestra conductor. Frijolita, stopping
at the most expensive hotel, had dispatched
them to the sort of hostelry where itinerant travel-writers
were forced to stay, and they were much incensed.
But to our room came the minor devotees
of art from the Nicaraguan population to bask in
their glory, and both Bosco and Maestro entertained
them with stories of Frijolita’s absurd temperament,
and with sly comments upon her age, suggesting
that she had not really danced before a crowned
head since Napoleon Bonaparte went into exile.</p>

<p>Bosco was a cheerful person. He was small and
rotund, but he sang divinely, and was not stingy
with his accomplishment. In the early morning he
poked a bleary countenance from his mosquito-net
and greeted the Indian servant-maid with an aria.
Then he would stroll out into the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i> in his pajamas,
carrying his guitar, to serenade the other ladies
of the establishment.</p>

<p>Maestro was a withered, elderly person, once famous
but fallen into obscurity. He was taciturn and
unsociable. His one love was his fiddle. He would
stroll away by himself to the back regions of the
hotel, where he found inspiration in the banana trees
and the rubbish heap, and there he would evoke
weird squeals from his instrument in an effort to
perfect what he described as a new technique.</p>

<p>Frijolita remained at the more expensive hotel,
giving out daily interviews to the press about the
many royal scions who had committed suicide because
she could not respond to their love. Her husband
sometimes came to call upon us. He was a
dapper little fellow; his hair was very long; his face
was always neatly powdered; his smile was endearing.
He would greet us with a gentle wave of the
hand or a gesture of his cane; ask after our health;
and withdraw gracefully, a vision of dainty, silken-clad
ankles, leaving a trail of haunting perfume behind
him.</p>

<p>A week elapsed. Maestro devoted it to informing
his acquaintances that Frijolita was treating him
like a dog. Then came the much-awaited début.</p>

<p>The theater was a shabby structure of European
design, its two balconies consisting of boxes and
loges, where sat the ladies of society. The unattached
men filled the pit, many with their hats on,
craning their necks to stare aloft. We waited an
hour and a half for the President. He finally
arrived. Every one rose. The orchestra played
the national anthem. It was greeted with vast applause.
Little withered Maestro turned and bowed.
Then the orchestra played again&mdash;that piece about
daybreak or springtime or something wherein the
trapdrummer usually toots upon a bird-whistle.
Here the trapdrummer had no bird-whistle. But
the curtain went up just the same, revealing a conventional
backdrop, and a huddled mass of plumes
in the foreground which proved to be none other
than Frijolita herself, apparently asleep.</p>

<p>More applause! Thunderous applause! It awakened
Frijolita. Very slowly she arose from the floor
and commenced to undulate. At some time in the
distant past, one sensed that she had been a great
dancer. Nowadays one felt that she had reached the
stage where she ought to interpret only the classics.
She was just a bit too heavy to do popular stuff.
But she was game. She undulated faster and faster.
She flitted and romped and turned somersaults.
Applause became a roar of approval. The music
ceased. She bowed, leaped behind the curtain,
emerged in a Spanish shawl, unwound it and threw
it away, leaped back behind the curtain, emerged in
another shawl&mdash;</p>

<p>There were fourteen shawls to be unwound, while
the roar grew to a tumult. Then she was gone.
Bosco, who was not singing to-night, came out of
the wings, and hurried through the auditorium with
a preoccupied air to let the public know he was connected
in some way with the troupe, while Maestro
acknowledged with grateful genuflections the approval
of the spectators. It was an exhibition such
as might be seen in any second-rate vaudeville house
on Broadway as a curtain-raiser, but it was an event
in Managua. Most of the Nicaraguans recognized it
as an inferior performance, but outwardly they
maintained an air of joyous appreciation largely
patriotic.</p>

<p>Frijolita had no supporting troupe. There was
a brief intermission; then she broke loose again.
This time she displayed an elephantine pair of bare
legs, and the roar of approval increased. Again and
again she danced, interpreting thereby&mdash;according
to the program&mdash;the latest wiggles of every land
from Egypt to Japan. She came finally to her masterpiece,
the genuine Hawaiian hula-hula. And then
occurred the unexpected climax. Maestro, either by
accident or malicious design, stopped his music too
soon, leaving her with one foot in the air.</p>

<p>Frijolita flew into a rage. Her far-famed temperament
burst all bounds. Rushing to front-stage, she
screamed revilement at the musician. All Managua
cheered her. Rising in his wrath, Maestro screamed
revilement at her. And all Managua cheered <em>him</em>.
Frijolita was outraged. She seized such pieces of
scenery as were not nailed down, and commenced to
hurl them. The President, feeling that the whole
affair was beneath his dignity, took his departure.
Frijolita’s husband came teetering forward to mediate.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Qué pasa?</i>” he inquired pleasantly. “What’s
the trouble?”</p>

<p>Frijolita glared at him.</p>

<p>“What sort of man are you? Why don’t you defend
me?”</p>

<p>He fled before another shower of scenery, and
Frijolita fled after him. Managua carried the little
Maestro out upon its shoulders, and treated him to
champagne, delighted at the unanticipated entertainment
he had offered.</p>

<p>But the next day the local papers did not mention
the incident. Perhaps the editors felt that they
must maintain appearances, and that Managua’s
semi-annual outburst of culture should pass off&mdash;in
the press at least&mdash;with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</i>. Or perhaps they had
already composed their poems, and could not deny
themselves the satisfaction of publishing them. For
the verses appeared, neatly boxed on the first page,
eulogizing the performance of the incomparable
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">artiste</i>, Frijolita.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>Managua, of late, has gone in for sports.</p>

<p>The marines have taught the natives to box and to
play baseball. In the latter game, the Nicaraguan
boys invariably defeat their mentors. In boxing,
they still have much to learn, but they are promising.</p>

<p>The newspapers write up the events with a Latin-American
flavor. In the advertisement of a baseball
match, the public is advised not to miss:</p>

<p>“A wonderful sporting event! Colossal stealing
of bases! Lightning-light flight of ball from pitcher
to catcher! Formidable blows of the bat! Thrilling
to the emotions! Do not miss it! Do not miss it!
To the field on Sunday at the ten of the morning!
To the field!”</p>

<p>Baseball is firmly established. Boxing has long
been opposed in Latin America as a brutal amusement
suitable only to <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringos</i>, but it has gained
much popularity since the advent of Firpo.</p>

<p>One Sunday afternoon I drifted out to the field
to see the local champions. There was a rickety
grand-stand, but the ring stood far away from it in
the center of a bare pasture. If one wished a ringside
seat, one could take a camp-chair and move it
wherever he pleased. Every one started back in the
shade of the stand, and edged his seat forward as
the shadows lengthened, finally reaching the ring in
time for the final bout.</p>

<p>The promoter acted as introducer and referee.
He was a prominent local politician&mdash;a large, stout
gentleman in a big leather <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">sombrero</i>. He commenced
with two diminutive urchins, who knew nothing
of boxing; they fought so gamely that they were
fagged before the end of the first round, but they
struggled through three of them, obtaining additional
rest while the promoter explained that they
must not kick or bite, and then returning to the fray
to put both hands together and shove them toward
the adversary’s face.</p>

<p>Next came two older boys. Then two full-grown
men, one barefoot, one in shoes and silk shirt. The
barefoot one, a wild-looking Indian with dark face
and long hair, had evidently learned his strategy by
watching game-cocks. He kept edging sidewise as
though he did not see the other fellow. He would
start his swing by winding up like a baseball pitcher.
The other could always see it coming and leap aside,
but it was an unwieldy swing, and the other invariably
jumped into it, until his silk shirt was crimson.
The spectators were delighted. They could not
appreciate science, but they recognized blood when
they saw it, and screamed their approval. The
Indian won.</p>

<p>Then came the semi-finals and the finals. Here
the participants were trained to some extent, but
they were handicapped by Latin vanity. They were
constantly posing before the crowd. Between the
rounds, instead of resting, they would turn to their
admirers to make a speech. “He got me by accident
last time, but I’ll show you something when the
bell rings.” If one were knocked to the floor, instead
of taking his count of nine even when he sadly
needed it, he would leap immediately to his feet,
determined to redeem himself in the eyes of his followers.
Or one of them, having backed the other
against the ropes and pummeled him to a pulp,
would forgo his advantage to listen to the applause.</p>

<p>But these men were fighters. The old phrase,
“the fistless Latin,” is rapidly becoming obsolete.
These scrappers never stalled or clinched to save
themselves or to gain time. They fought harder
than any American pugilist. And they had infinite
courage. In the final bout one youth was greatly
outweighed; his opponent cut his eye in the very
first round so that he was almost blinded; even the
Nicaraguan spectators, much as they loved gore,
suggested that the battle should stop, but the little
fellow insisted on continuing; he was beaten into a
bloody mess, knocked down again and again,
pounded until it became a torture, but he never wavered;
the moment he regained his feet he rushed
forward courageously for additional punishment
with a fortitude that no Anglo-Saxon could surpass.</p>

<p>In many phases of life these people acquit themselves
as poor sportsmen, especially in their politics,
but they are learning. Sportsmanship, after all, is
not a hereditary virtue, but one acquired through
experience. What American can not recall the many
squabbles that marked his earliest boyhood ventures
into athletics? It is only by training that one learns
to abide by the decision of an umpire. I was rather
amazed to notice that not one of the Nicaraguan
boxers contested the decision of the referee.</p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p>The one American resident that the Managua
newspapers do not occasionally attack is the Marine.</p>

<p>Some years ago one periodical published an editorial
accusing the Legation Guard of general misconduct,
whereupon the soldiers promptly wrecked
its plant. No such accusations have been repeated.</p>

<p>There are about a hundred and fifty marines in
Managua. They were the cleanest-cut body of
young men that I had ever seen anywhere. There
was no drunkenness among them, no rough-house, no
swaggering or bullying attitude toward the natives,
no tendency to pick a fight with the local police.</p>

<p>“The only difficulty we ever have,” said the
American minister, John E. Ramer, “is that now
and then one of them falls in love with a Nicaraguan
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señorita</i>. The lad might be able to support her in
her accustomed luxury here, but he couldn’t do it
at home. Consequently, for the best interests of
both parties, the officers&mdash;if they see it coming&mdash;try
to cheat Cupid by transferring the man to another
post.”</p>

<p>The barracks are situated on the outskirts of town.
The men are well quartered&mdash;with drill-grounds,
club, baseball diamond, moving picture theater, and
tennis courts&mdash;and so completely comfortable that
a Nicaraguan president, paying a visit to the camp,
once threw up his hands in astonishment with the
exclamation:</p>

<p>“Your privates live like generals!”</p>

<p>Adjacent to their cantonment is that of the Nicaraguan
soldiers. I strolled over to the native barracks
one day with Corporal Landy, the Legation
orderly.</p>

<p>“Hello, you bandits!” he greeted them, and all
the Nicaraguans grinned. “These devils,” he explained
to me in Spanish, that they might hear,
“never have any drill or fatigue or anything else to
do except to sit around and watch us sweat.” And
they all chuckled good-humoredly, as though they
liked it. Very casually he took the gun away from
a native sentry to show me the rust upon it. “And
that cannon they have there, if you were to fire it,
would turn a somersault and land on its back.”</p>

<p>They talked together on friendly terms about the
night last year when a revolution was expected.
Each had the other covered with machine-guns in
case of an emergency. They laugh about it now, and
each assures the other, “I was aiming straight at
<em>you</em> that night.”</p>

<p>I attended an inspection one Saturday morning.
The <i>Rochester</i>, previously at Amapala, had reached
Corinto, and Admiral Dayton came up to inspect the
troops. There was a close-order drill, then extended
order, then fire call, and finally the call to arms
wherein every man took the post he would take in
case of actual fighting in Managua. The bugle rang
out. There was a scurrying of machine-gunners to
the various emplacements about the barracks.
Down by the front entrance the sallying party
formed to charge with fixed bayonets through the
streets of Managua.</p>

<p>Just across the line, the Nicaraguan troops sat
cross-legged on the ground, and grinned appreciatively,
as though they felt that this was an exhibition
staged for their personal entertainment. They
themselves were never called upon to practice for
such emergencies. When the marines first did it,
some years ago, the native soldiers had all scurried
back into the barracks to get their own guns, while
an anxious presidential voice came over the telephone
wire to the American Legation, demanding:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter in your camp? Your marines
are running about like madmen! Are they declaring
war upon us?”</p>

<p>They soon assembled again, and marched back to
the barracks, while the band played “Dixie,” and
the stars and stripes floated in the breeze. This
whole occupation, because of its aspect in foreign
eyes, was a thing that might be deplored, but what
Yankee in a far-away land would not be thrilled at
the sight?</p>


<h3>XII</h3>

<p>It is natural that the Nicaraguan resents American
intervention.</p>

<p>There exists in the Latin-American’s character a
combination of inefficiency and pride which induces
the inferiority complex. His inefficiency sometimes
leads him into a muddle from which he is unable to
extricate himself. He invites the foreigner to help
him out. Then his pride asserts itself. He resents
the fact that he has been obliged to call upon the
foreigner. He proceeds thereupon to damn him.</p>

<p>During my stay in Managua, the rumor circulated
about&mdash;an ever recurrent rumor there&mdash;that the
marines were to be withdrawn. Inside of an hour
the American Legation was filled with diplomats
from foreign countries, and merchants who owned
property in Nicaragua, all anxious to know if the
rumor were true, all fearful of the destructive revolution
that would follow overnight, all eager to protest
against the withdrawal of the much-abused
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringos</i>.</p>

<p>In the crowd were many Nicaraguans who had
been loudest in their condemnation of the United
States.</p>


<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>Like most persons with the inferiority complex,
the Latin-American is extremely sensitive. He resents,
even more than the humiliation of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i>
assistance, the assumption of loftier worth which
usually characterizes the Anglo-Saxon.</p>

<p>This assumption, to us, is often quite unconscious.
If we are aware of our national self-satisfaction,
most of us try to hide it when traveling in the southern
republics. Our diplomats and business men seek
valiantly to proclaim our great admiration of our
neighbors. It has become the fashion in our writing
to promote an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entente cordiale</i> by flattering the
people of these countries. The charming woman
writer in particular&mdash;who makes a brief trip to the
more modern cities of Chile and the Argentine,
meets only the aristocracy, and completes her book
as a bread-and-butter letter to the delightful people
who fed her tea and cakes&mdash;is inclined nowadays, in
her impulse to jolt out of his complacency the reader
at home, to picture all the Latin-Americans as infinitely
superior to our own crude selves.</p>

<p>Yet all of us, even though we may have acquired
a strong affection for our friends of the southland,
still consider ourselves their peers. We know that
every <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i> is not to be ranked above every Latin-American.
But we are confident that man for man&mdash;lawyer
for lawyer, doctor for doctor, soldier for
soldier, farmer for farmer&mdash;the Anglo-Saxon usually
surpasses his counterpart in physique, intelligence,
education, ability and character, if not in
refinement. The Latin-American himself is aware
of the contrast. He may, and sometimes does, voluntarily
admit it. But he is naturally a trifle resentful
when the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i>, by word or action, reminds him
of it.</p>

<p>We remind him quite frequently. The most considerate
traveler will lapse unintentionally at times
into an attitude of condescension. Our kindly
church-goers at home contribute their pennies to
missionary enterprises in order that he may be
educated and uplifted. And as though this were
not the supreme height of international insult, however
much he may actually need education and uplift,
we appoint ourselves the policemen of the continent,
take him under our paternal wing, and
threaten to spank him if he misbehaves.</p>

<p>We assume that he should appreciate our kindliness
and love us as the big brother we consider
ourselves to be. On the contrary, he not only dislikes
us as a nation, but distrusts our motives. He
looks upon us&mdash;and frequently with good cause&mdash;as
hypocrites who pat him upon the back as a prelude
to selling him American products. In our missionary
efforts he sees only a colossal national vanity.
In the application of our Monroe Doctrine he scents
an ambition for the conquest of his country.</p>

<p>To the average American this last statement may
sound ridiculous. When we promulgated that doctrine,
we thought only of Europe. It was later, when
we realized that European nations might disregard
it unless their citizens or property were protected in
Latin America that we undertook to supervise the
conduct of our neighbors’ wars and revolutions.
Our ambitions for conquest at present are purely
commercial. But there are several incidents in our
past history which these little republics remember
with foreboding. They remember, for instance, that
we fought with Mexico about Texas, and emerged
victorious with Arizona, Utah, Nevada, and California.
They feel that there is something a little
funny in the way Panama started its revolution
against Colombia just about the time we wished to
build the Panama Canal. They question our philanthropic
motives in Nicaragua. They are always
wondering where the lightning may strike next.</p>

<p>So firmly convinced are most of our neighbors that
we are what they always describe as “the grasping
Colossus of the North,” that when our government
exercises forbearance, they merely suspect us of
cowardice. When Woodrow Wilson for many years
let Mexico literally get away with murder, his idealism
was misunderstood. For a time Latin America
looked upon the United States as a braggart that
never executed its repeated diplomatic threats.
Carranza, the special protégé of our State Department,
posed before the neighboring presidents as a
guardian of Latin-American rights, and had envoys
touring the southern continent in an effort to align
Guatemala, Nicaragua, Colombia, Chile, Argentina,
and other countries, in a secret <span id="entente"><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entente</i> against</span> the
United States.</p>

<p>Personally I dislike our meddling in Latin-American
affairs. It seems to me that it should be any
government’s privilege to run a revolution in its
own country if it so chooses. But there are many
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringos</i> in all these republics, who came there in
accordance with local constitutional guarantees, and
sometimes at the invitation of the government itself,
who must be protected. If we do not occasionally
step in, Europe will. Latin America&mdash;with the exception
of the few nations which conduct their elections
in peace&mdash;expects it. The Latin-American
resents it, but he despises us when we abstain.</p>

<p>If we are to uphold our prestige, however, we
must apply our foreign policies&mdash;whatever they
may be&mdash;to all republics consistently.</p>

<p>“We never know just what to expect from your
government,” a Supreme Court justice said to me in
Honduras. “You tell us again and again, for instance,
that you will recognize only a constitutionally
elected president, who gains office without force.
Yet to-day you have recognized nine Latin-American
presidents who did gain office by force.”</p>

<p>These were the presidents of Peru, Bolivia, Venezuela,
Nicaragua, Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala,
Santo Domingo, and Mexico.</p>

<p>“And you tell us also,” continued the Justice,
“that at all times, we must protect American property.
If we of the little countries do not, you immediately
send down your gunboats. In Nicaragua,
two American filibusters, convicted of murder, are
executed, and presently you take over the entire
country. In Mexico, during many revolutions,
countless Americans are slain, and much property
damaged, and you content yourselves with writing
notes. To us of the little countries, it all seems very
unfair.”</p>

<p>As to the recognition of Latin-American presidents,
Heaven help the State Department to apply a
consistent rule, when so few are legitimately elected!
But as to the protection of American property,
there can be but one right course. Either it is not
worth protecting, or it is, whether it be in Nicaragua
or Mexico. Practically all Central-Americans to-day,
although too polite to voice their opinion, look
upon us as something of a bully who picks on the
weaker republics.</p>


<h3>XIV</h3>

<p>That they are so friendly, despite their fancied
grievances, is a tribute to the natural kindliness of
these people.</p>

<p>Even in Nicaragua, although the press may attack
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i>, the people as a whole are cordial to any
individual American who will meet them half-way.</p>

<p>“I went home last year,” said one of the Old-Timers.
“I’d been here for ten years, but no one
in my own town seemed to make much of a fuss over
me. They just shook hands and remarked, ‘Let’s
see; you’ve been away, haven’t you?’ But when I
came back and stepped off the train in Managua,
every porter and coachman on the platform recognized
me. The bootblacks grinned all over their
dirty brown faces. And my neighbors all came
hurrying to my house to hug me, and slap me on the
back, and make those funny gurgling noises. That
was my real homecoming.”</p>

<small>A LONG, LONG WAY TO COSTA RICA</small></h2>
</div>




<h3>I</h3>

<p>I set out overland&mdash;through the Nicaraguan
Canal&mdash;for Costa Rica.</p>

<p>From Managua the railway carried me to
Granada, on the shores of the largest lake between
Michigan and Titicaca. At the end of a long wharf
the weekly steamer was balancing itself upon its
prow and waving its stern in the air, lashed by a
gale that piled the combers one upon another until
the pond resembled a young ocean.</p>

<p>It was a squatty vessel, condemned back in the
days of Zelaya, but still running. It contained several
bullet holes from the revolution that overthrew
the dictator. When attacked, it had been so crowded
with government troops that most of them could not
fire upon the enemy, wherefore they had relieved
their emotions by shooting upward through the
decks.</p>

<p>Embarking passengers were looking forward to
seasickness. The Latin-Americans always enjoy
this malady, even when the sea is calm. Upon going
aboard a ship, the womenfolk especially prepare for
it by hanging upon the cabin wall a picture of “Our
Lady of Voyagings,” reciting the rosary, sniffing
the smelling salts, lying down upon the berth, turning
green, and suffering miserably long before the
ship leaves port. Such behavior seems to be regarded
as essential to the gentle feminine character,
and I sometimes suspect that any lady who failed to
show the proper symptoms during a voyage would be
regarded as just a trifle masculine.</p>

<p>On this trip they all had excellent excuse. The
boat rocked and pitched frantically at its moorings.
When we finally steamed off, our course lay broadside
to the waves, and the vessel dipped one
gunwale after the other, soaking the steerage passengers
on the lower deck, and sprinkling those
above. They huddled together in a dejected, uncomfortable
mass of humanity, groaning “Ay! Ay!
Ay!” and obtaining therefrom about as much relief
as Anglo-Saxons find in “Oh! Oh! Oh!”</p>

<p>Lake Nicaragua is a hundred miles long by forty
wide. Since it was a twenty-four hour journey,
much agony was enjoyed by all.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>I landed the next morning at San Carlos, at the
mouth of the San Juan River. There was nothing of
interest here except an ancient Spanish fortress and
J. C. Kennedy.</p>

<p>“They built the fortress back in 1600-and-something,
or maybe it was 1700-and-something,” explained
the latter. “I know it was just before I
came here.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kennedy, a little white-haired Irish-American,
who now owned a shoe-shop and pegged away
himself for exercise, had twice been chased out of
Nicaragua by the old tyrant, Zelaya.</p>

<p>“But I don’t know as I blame him so much,” he
said. “I had a factory making ammunition for the
revolutionists.”</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>From San Carlos the San Juan River led eastward
toward the Caribbean. Once seriously considered
by the American government as a possible
site for the canal finally constructed at Panama, it
was at present so shallow that only small launches
could navigate it.</p>

<p>One was now waiting, with a scow lashed to its
side.</p>

<p>I sailed with it at midnight, along with some forty
other passengers, mostly women and children, all of
us tightly packed into whatever spaces remained
among the bags, boxes, and bales of a heavy cargo.
There was neither comfort nor privacy. The Latin-Americans,
with characteristic vanity, had all embarked
in their very best clothes. Now that they had
parted from their friends, and wished to change into
garments better suited to a long voyage, they faced
a disconcerting problem.</p>

<p>The women cried out: “Gentlemen, please look the
other way!”</p>

<p>A host of infants whined and fretted. Every one
turned and twisted about in an effort to find a position
conducive to sleep, until the launch suggested
a cheese alive with squirming maggots.</p>

<p>I retired to the lighter, and discovering a sheltered
nook among the sacks of beans, rolled up in
my blanket. There was a splendid moon overhead.
The black jungle, illumined now and then with
patches of misty gray, slid past in mysterious procession.
At times I would awaken as the motor
stopped and the native boatmen climbed over me
to guide us with long poles through rippling shallows.
Sometimes the claw-like branches of a half-submerged
tree came racing at us, as though shooting
upstream to seize us; there would be much frantic
shouting, and furious work with the guiding-poles
as we dodged it; then I would settle back to another
nap, lulled by the music of swift waters, and
pitying the other passengers huddled in cramped
discomfort aboard the launch.</p>

<p class="center space-above"><span class="figcenter" id="i_034">
  <img src="images/034.jpg" class="w75"  alt="FOR THREE DAYS THE BOATMEN POLED THE LAUNCH THROUGH
SHALLOWS FRAMED IN RANK GREEN JUNGLE" />
</span></p>
<p class="center">FOR THREE DAYS THE BOATMEN POLED THE LAUNCH THROUGH
SHALLOWS FRAMED IN RANK GREEN JUNGLE<br /></p>

<p>But the pity was premature. Without warning
the heavens opened up, and poured down a perfect
deluge of chilling rain, and I found myself the only
passenger not under a roof and with no space left
under the awning. I had not known that every
season was rainy season on the San Juan. And the
deluge fell intermittently throughout the night.
Drawing the blanket over my head, I burrowed
down between two bean-sacks, where presently a
boatman rushing across the scow with his pole gave
a leap and planted both bare feet in my face.</p>

<p>“Pardon, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</i>, but you looked like part of the
cargo!”</p>

<p>In the morning we docked at Puerto Castillo, a
string of aged wooden shanties bordering the river,
shrouded in an unceasing drizzle of mist. There
were some especially dangerous rapids here, and the
women were landed while the rest of us charged
downstream through boiling foam. Our launch
bumped and grated over the rocks as we plunged
through the shallow falls, but the current swept us
on, and we came finally into deeper pools below,
where the women, straggling along the shore-trail,
rejoined us, and crawled over one another as each
sought to find her own baggage among the mixture
of sacks, bundles, baskets and boxes, and to extract
therefrom the ingredients for breakfast.</p>

<p>Each passenger foraged for himself. For three
days we chugged downstream through rank green
jungle with bits of fog clinging to its edges, through
shallows and rapids, through drizzling showers.
Every one had taken the precaution to bring food,
which we ate without cooking. Now and then, if
we stopped at a thatched hut, a native woman could
be persuaded to boil coffee, but it was seldom that
we stopped long enough. With both sexes packed
tightly into an open launch for many hours at a
time, there was necessary a complete abandonment
of the modesties which civilized society regards as
imperative. When passengers complained, the captain
agreed with them sympathetically, in the fatalistic
fashion of these people, as though he felt that
the discomfort were something to be deplored, but
not to be remedied.</p>

<p>The captain was in reality a “Colonel” by title.
Several of the men passengers were “Generals.”
Most Nicaraguans of any social standing have a
military title of some sort, earned in a long-past
revolution. Two or three of the women were the
wives of government officials stationed in Bluefields
or other isolated east coast towns, and were ladies
of refinement. But contiguity was productive of
democracy, and both ladies and Generals joined the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peons</i> in lamentation of common misery.</p>

<p>The life of the party was a stout woman with a
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">machete</i> in the bosom of her voluminous soiled
shirtwaist. Her seven children were constantly
tumbling about over the other passengers to the
annoyance of every one, and her admonitions that
she would cut their throats if they did not sit still,
illustrated by a waving of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">machete</i>, had little
effect upon them. On the lake steamer, she had led
the mournful chorus of “Ay! Ay! Ay!” but she
was now in good spirits and prepared at all times to
conduct the conversation.</p>

<p>Her favorite theme was her romances.</p>

<p>“The oldest boy&mdash;he of the curly hair&mdash;was the
son of Juanito, the blacksmith. And that one&mdash;the
dark one&mdash;is the child of Pedro, the little Indian at
San Carlos.”</p>

<p>She had left the blacksmith, it seems, because he
caught her at flirtation, and <span id="chastise">failed to chastise</span> the
other man. He had simply taken <em>her</em> home, and
beaten <em>her</em>. She had not minded this, for it was
justified. But he should have beaten the other man,
too. Did we not think so? And who could love such
a coward?</p>

<p>We stopped on our third night at a little thatched
farmhouse. While the women remained aboard the
launch, reciting their rosaries in unison, as was their
nightly custom throughout the voyage, the men adjourned
to a narrow sandspit, opened a jug of rum,
and took turns riding a young bull, which, despite
its youth, contrived to toss most of them into the
river. Thereafter we gathered at the farmhouse,
where some one produced guitar and mandolin, and
we all danced with the farmer’s three daughters.
There was some question in my mind as to whether
a gentleman about to dance with a barefoot partner
should remove his own shoes. The book of etiquette,
as I recalled it, had not covered this point. But,
considering that the boards were full of splinters
which might have been painful to any but the calloused
sole of a native, I decided to forgo the courtesy.
When the boatmen and passengers discovered
that I could play a few pieces of their own music on
the mandolin, they hailed me as “Paisano”&mdash;“fellow-countryman”&mdash;and
thereafter called me by
that name. These Nicaraguans were prejudiced
against <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringos</i>, but like all Latin-Americans, were
eager to be friendly with any individual who showed
an interest in themselves.</p>

<p>One of the Generals could speak English. His
hobby was collecting the pictures of short-skirted
movie-actresses that came with each package of the
cigarettes I smoked.</p>

<p>“Those American girl are some nifty girl, eh?
All the time I am in the Nueva York I go always to
the dance-hall to shake the&mdash;the what-do-you-call-it?&mdash;the
wicked hip. And so mooch I like the scenic
railway at the Coney Island&mdash;the one that go all the
time through the dark tunnel! Some classy burg,
that Nueva York!”</p>

<p>When the rain ceased momentarily, the men would
ascend to the roof of the launch, among the crates
of squawking chickens that formed the bulk of the
cargo, and from that point of vantage would shoot
at the alligators lying half-submerged along the
mud-flats. The caymans were sluggish creatures.
On the Amazon and other rivers, I have seen much
larger monsters disappear with the crack of a rifle.
Here they merely lumbered with awkward dignity
toward the water. The boatmen showed no fear of
them. When we struck a sandbar, as we did at two-hour
intervals, the crew would leap overboard to
shove us loose, and sometimes would plod all over
the river to find the deeper channels.</p>

<p>If this were ever to become an interoceanic canal,
it would require infinite dredging. Yet, should
traffic outgrow the Panama waterway, this will be
the site of another road. The mountain chain which
soars aloft throughout Central America subsides at
this point. <span id="lake">Lake Nicaragua is only a hundred and
ten feet above sea level</span>, and from it another river
empties into the Pacific just as the San Juan empties
into the Caribbean. The principal disadvantage
of a canal here would be its length. Any surveyor
or engineer, making the journey as I made it,
would swear that the San Juan was longer than the
Mississippi.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>It was a relief when, after three days of it, we
turned aside into a narrow channel, and pushed our
way through lily-pads to the weather-stained city of
San Juan del Norte, otherwise known as Greytown,
our Caribbean terminus.</p>

<p>It was merely the typical East coast town, however&mdash;low,
swampy, stinking, and generally unattractive&mdash;with
black complexions prevailing. The
Nicaraguan <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">commandante</i> was Spanish. All other
officials were negroes. A customs’ inspector of West
Indian descent, as immaculate in white linen uniform
as only a colored official can be, directed me to
a lodging house, and I set out to find it, hiking along
a grass-grown embankment lined with rickety
wooden shacks roofed with discolored tin, each
house set upon piles above a pool of filth, and
reached by a wobbly board-walk.</p>

</span></p>
<p class="center">GREYTOWN WAS A TYPICAL EAST COAST PORT&mdash;LOW, SWAMPY AND
UNATTRACTIVE&mdash;WITH BLACK COMPLEXIONS PREVAILING<br /></p>

<p>Once upon a time&mdash;when this whole shore from
Costa Rica to Guatemala was a part of the British
“Mosquito kingdom,” of which British Honduras
is the only remnant&mdash;this was a thriving city.
Walker, the Filibuster, made it his base of supplies.
In the days of the gold rush to California, Nicaragua
was one of the favorite cross-continental routes.
In those times, as the residents of to-day expressed
it, “Greytown was Greytown.” Now it was only
Greytown. Prosperity had fled. The inhabitants
lived, as tropical natives so frequently live, without
visible occupation. A visitor, especially a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i>,
was a curiosity. The entire population&mdash;descendants
of Great Britain’s former negro empire&mdash;rushed
to the doorways to stare. Buxom wenches
climbed upon their window-sills with a mountainous
display of anatomy to ask one another in
Jamaican English:</p>

<p>“Who the mon is? Who the mon is?”</p>

<p>I found the lodging house, but it was closed.</p>

<p>“Dey all go off for a lark,” advised a neighbor.</p>

<p>But eventually I found another hotel, kept by a
Nicaraguan, who was quite amazed at the sight of
a prospective guest. He had one large room, laden
with canvas cots, and already occupied by a blind
negro with the stupid countenance of a half-wit, who
proved upon further acquaintance to be the town
celebrity.</p>

<p>He was a musician. When some one led him
downstairs and placed a mandolin in his hands, he
played it as I had never dreamed the instrument
could be played. He was a true genius. If his accompanist
gave the wrong chord upon the guitar,
he would fly into a rage. When, as a joke, some one
told him that I played better than he, his indignation
knew no limit. His eyelids snapped open and
shut, exposing empty sockets, and he screamed like
a maniac. He refused positively to play another
piece so long as I was present. Thereafter he
seemed to sense my return, even when I tiptoed into
the room, and would cease abruptly to demand in
Spanish:</p>

<p>“Has that <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i> come back?”</p>

<p>But he warmed toward me when mediators informed
him that I wished to take his picture. All
Greytown was eager to be photographed. Seeing
my camera, the blacks would call out, “Draw me
portrait, sah?” There were many old colored men
here who could recall the days when Greytown flourished.
They were very dignified and formal, as
befits a patriarch, and with the peculiar vanity of
the oldest living resident everywhere, each was extremely
proud that he hadn’t had sufficient ambition
to move out of one place for sixty or seventy years.
They now spent most of their time sitting about the
rum shops, waiting for some one to buy them a
drink.</p>

<p>As I passed one such shop&mdash;and it seemed to be
about the one kind of shop in the city&mdash;a group of
my former associates from the launch journey
greeted me with an overjoyed, “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Paisano!</i>” and
called me inside, assuring the colony of patriarchs,
“This <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i> is a good fellow! He’s our <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">paisano</i>!
He’s one of us!” With that recommendation the
darkies accepted me as an equal. Theirs was the
elaborate phraseology of the Jamaican:</p>

<p>“When I first see he,” they said, “I presumption
that he be American.” And to me, “Am I not conclusive,
sah, that you be a traveler, and that you
will embrace the primary opportunity to emigrate
from this region?”</p>

<p>My former associates were rather tipsy with rum,
and all were eager to show me the sights of the city.
The only point of interest they could think of, however,
was the chapel across the way. It had fallen
greatly into disrepair, since the Church of England
is a more favored institution on the East Coast, but
it contained a well-molded image of the Saviour.
Some local artist evidently had done the work, for
the complexion of the image was a rich chocolate
brown. The natives looked upon Him with astonishment.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Carramba!</i>” exclaimed one. “He’s as dark as
ourselves! He’s our <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">paisano</i>!”</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>A motor-schooner was about to leave for Costa
Rica.</p>

<p>Its skipper was a Cayman Islander&mdash;a hard-faced
ruffian with a whiskey-shaded mustache, who might
have passed for a white man were it not for his
Jamaican speech. Its crew was composed of semi-naked
blacks. But all of them understood seamanship,
which was fortunate, for the passing of the
Red Bar, at the mouth of the San Juan, is fraught
with danger.</p>

<p>We crept out through a winding channel. Giant
combers, sweeping across the low sandspit, caught
us broadside, and turned the little craft until the
gunwale dipped water. Again and again they piled
us against the opposite bank, while great sheets of
spray broke over us and sizzled through the rigging.</p>

<p>The skipper, braced against the wheel, shouted
orders that flew to leeward with the screaming wind.
The blacks, seemingly unmindful of their peril,
leaned their weight upon their poles as they struggled
to pry us loose, while a dozen sharks cruised
hungrily below. Natives affirm that the sea-tigers
gather about each passing ship, and are seldom disappointed.
There were moments when it appeared
that they might enjoy their accustomed banquet.
But at last we were safe, and climbing up the mountainous
waves toward the open sea, while the boatmen
raised lusty voices in a chantey of the old-time
pirates. And with a stiff breeze filling out sails,
we scudded southward toward Costa Rica, the most
charming land in the world.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Five years earlier I had visited Costa Rica&mdash;after
my flight from Mexico&mdash;and it was good to see it
again.</p>

<p>We threaded our way among the reefs of Limón
harbor, toward a sickle of white beach fringed with
graceful coco-palms. In the distance rose lofty
mountains, verdant with forest and jungle, towering
up and up toward the filmy white clouds. Over it all
was the bluest of skies. This was the land which
admiring Spaniards, years ago, christened “Rich
Coast,” and no country has ever been more aptly
named.</p>

<p>Limón itself was merely an average East Coast
port&mdash;a city of rickety wooden houses behind a large
banana wharf, with a population of Jamaican blacks
imported by the Fruit Company, which owns this
Caribbean shore. But the railway&mdash;incidentally a
Fruit Company possession, and one of the three
most famous scenic routes in Latin America&mdash;carried
me inland through an ever-changing panorama
of cane fields, banana plantation, thatched villages,
and untrammeled jungle, through forests of magnificent
big trees festooned with moss and vine,
through rugged gulches beside a foaming river, up
mountain sides where the stream dropped to a mere
white ribbon far below, along winding cliffs that
looked out upon endless vistas of waving palm tops,
up into the exhilarating coolness of the altitudes,
among rolling hills of luxuriant coffee plantation,
past the red-tiled roofs of ancient Cartago, and
down again into a fertile valley dotted with little
farms, into San José, the most delightful capital in
Central America&mdash;a city of quaint Spanish architecture,
yet with every modern comfort&mdash;a quiet,
peaceful city slumbering beneath a warm sun that
never burns&mdash;a city with the loveliest climate, the
most attractive <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plazas</i>, and the most beautiful
women in the world. Every town of any note in
Latin America claims these superlatives as its own.
Every traveler I have met joins me in awarding
them to San José.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Costa Rica is not only the most charming country
in Central America, but usually the best-behaved.</p>

<p>So stable is its government that land upon the
Costa Rican side of the San Juan River is far more
valuable than the same sort of property on the Nicaraguan
side.</p>

<p>It is one of the few countries south of the Rio
Grande which can elect a new president without
shooting the old one. Its leading families are so
interrelated that the chief executiveship is largely
a household affair. As a general rule, they take
turns at it. Now and then, when they do quarrel
about it, each family separates, half of it taking one
side and half the other, so that everybody always
wins. And whoever gains the office rules ordinarily
with consideration for the rest of the populace.</p>

<p>In many recent years there has been but one
period of rough-house in its ordinarily tranquil history.
It was my fortune, on my first visit to the republic,
to arrive just in time to witness its conclusion&mdash;the
conclusion of such a series of events as
might have sprung from the pages of a novel by
Richard Harding Davis. I landed at Puerto Limón
just in time to see Ex-President Federico Tinoco,
the last of the Central-American tyrants, walk
across the dock between two lines of fixed bayonets,
and embark for Europe, carrying with him the national
treasury.</p>

<p>The story of Tinoco would be much more typical
of Honduras than of Costa Rica.</p>

<p>As in Tegucigalpa there were three contestants
for the presidency in the elections of 1919. No one
of them gained an absolute majority. Congress,
forced to decide, bickered as Congresses will. The
president in office, scenting possible trouble, undertook
to smooth the path of his own favorite by building
up a stronger army. At the head of it was
Federico Tinoco, a man of prominent family, himself
little known in Costa Rica except as a devotee of
pleasure who spent most of his time in Paris.</p>

<p>When the army was well organized, Tinoco
cleared the whole situation by capturing the palace
and declaring <em>himself</em> president. Thereupon he reorganized
Congress with his own personal friends,
and was constitutionally elected. There were
rumors&mdash;as always in these countries&mdash;that an
American concession hunter financed the whole
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</i>. It is more probable that Tinoco’s family influenced
the move.</p>

<p class="center space-above"><span class="figcenter" id="i_037">
  <img src="images/037.jpg" class="w50"  alt="A MACHINE-GUN TOWER BUILT BY THE TYRANT TINOCO" />
</span></p>
<p class="center">A MACHINE-GUN TOWER BUILT BY THE TYRANT TINOCO<br /></p>

<p>Federico, the Dictator, was himself a weak, timid,
vacillating man. The real power behind the throne
was a younger brother, Joaquín, who became the
Secretary of War. Young, cultured, charming, the
handsomest man in a nation of handsome men, Joaquín
was a striking figure everywhere. Magnetic
beyond description, he could, in a five-minute conversation,
bring his worst enemy to his own point of
view. He had traveled throughout the world, had
been received in the most exclusive salons of many
European capitals, and spoke fluently several
languages. He could outride, outwrestle, outbox,
outfence, and outswim any youth in the Republic.
At philandering he was supreme. Now and then
some outraged husband challenged him to a duel, but
Joaquín could outshoot them all. When there were
murmurs against the high-handed methods by which
the Tinocos had attained office, he announced in
Congress:</p>

<p>“If any citizen disapproves of it, he can meet me
man to man with revolvers.”</p>

<p>Secure in his power, Joaquín led the life of a
young prince. He designed strikingly beautiful uniforms
for himself. He gave many gay parties. He
himself never drank, but there was always plenty
of champagne for his friends. He made costly presents
to his women, and not content with the local
beauties, he imported occasional high-class courtesans
from overseas.</p>

<p>His extravagances proved a drain upon the national
treasury. When President Federico protested,
Joaquín quickly overruled him. And Federico,
despite his desire to execute honestly the duties into
which family ambition had forced him, proceeded to
tax the country exorbitantly. When the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peons</i> had
no money left, he took their oxen. He confiscated
the beasts under pretense of using them for the
army, but sold them to cattlemen in the West Indies.
The reserves in the local banks he seized to pay the
interest on the national debt. At length, he commenced
to sell some of the art treasures in the
national theater.</p>

<p>It was his one remaining hope to secure a foreign
loan. Before capitalists would listen to his pleas,
however, he must secure the recognition of the
American government. In his efforts to win the
favor of Washington, he used every possible device.
He extended every courtesy to American citizens.
He joined the United States in declaring war on
Germany. He offered our War Department the use
of Costa Rican territory in the fortification of the
Canal Zone.</p>

<p>His stumbling block was Benjamin F. Chase,
American Consul in San José. In the absence of a
Minister, Mr. Chase was reporting to Washington
the current political history of Costa Rica. Being
a stubborn sort of Yankee, he was reporting the
truth, even though the Tinocos tried to make a pet
of him. Having failed to bribe the Consul, according
to rumors afloat at the time, the Dictator is said
to have hired another <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i> to shoot him. Several
of the more loyal Americans formed themselves into
a guard at the Consulate, and the Consul continued
to send home unfavorable reports on the Tinoco
régime.</p>

<p>All Costa Rica murmured its discontent at the
increasing taxation. Revolutions commenced to
brew. In the suppression of the uprisings, Joaquín
introduced a reign of terror. His spies were everywhere.
Political opponents were thrown into old-fashioned
wooden stocks and exhibited in public.
The prisons were filled. According to reports, prisoners
were frequently beaten with iron rods, and
sometimes hung up by the thumbs. Many of the
stories have the exaggerated ring of the yarns told
about Cabrera in Guatemala. They include those of
a man burned in oil, of gold teeth being extracted
and resold to dentists, and of a private swimming
pool where Joaquín, after depriving his prisoners of
water for forty-eight hours, would march them out
to see him diving and swimming in gallons of it.</p>

<p>The leading revolutionist, Don Julio Acosta, had
a force of two hundred men on the Nicaraguan border,
but Joaquín’s army numbered about ten thousand.
The revolutionists had neither arms nor
ammunition. Washington, following its traditional
policy of selling weapons only to constitutionally
elected presidents, whether they were crooks or not,
refused to sell to Don Julio, insisting that he work
out his own salvation.</p>

<p>Indirectly, it was Tinoco’s large army that caused
his own destruction. Knowing that all Costa Rica
hated him, he had strengthened it with soldiers of
fortune from Nicaragua and Honduras, of the type
who gravitate wherever there is trouble. They must
be paid. All other government employees could
wait. The school teachers, in protest, left their
schools, and marched through the streets with their
pupils. Emboldened by their example, the letter
carriers and the street cleaners followed. When the
police sought to disperse them, the women cried:</p>

<p>“We are your friends! We are protesting against
the cutting of your salaries to pay foreign soldiers!”</p>

<p>And the police stood back, while all San José
surged through the streets, shouting, “Down with
the Tinocos!” Joaquín at the time was absent from
the city. Hearing of the disturbance, he hastened
back, and led his troops in person, riding fearlessly
into the mob. Some of the women and children were
forced into the American Consulate, and surged upstairs
to the balcony. A young boy attempted a
speech. Tinoco soldiers drew their rifles and fired.
The crowd fled back inside the building, leaving Consul
Chase alone on the balcony. Eleven bullet holes
dented the stucco behind him, but he was not harmed.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of the end. Joaquín
quickly pacified the city, for no one dared to face
him. But&mdash;the Old-Timers suspect&mdash;a little note
came down from Washington. Federico, the nominal
Dictator, made plans for an exit. He handed
his resignation to the Vice-President, who appointed
him “Ambassador-at-Large” to Europe, with a
salary of $100,000 a year, payable in advance. All
of his cohorts received similar appointments&mdash;by
a procedure which, if unethical, was quite proper
according to international law&mdash;until their salaries
exhausted what little cash remained in the country.</p>

<p>Joaquín, the real Dictator, had no intention of
fleeing with them. Whatever might be said of him,
he was no coward. He meant to fight to the end.
But the end came unexpectedly. He was strolling
nonchalantly down the street one evening when a
man saluted him. Always military, Joaquín snapped
his own hand to his hat-brim. He did not observe
that the other man had saluted with the left hand,
or that the right concealed a revolver. As Joaquín’s
fingers touched the hat-brim, the man shot
him. Then he turned and ran up the street, blazing
into the air, and shouting:</p>

<p>“Joaquín is dead! Costa Rica lives!”</p>

<p>The elder Tinoco was at home in the castle when
the news reached him. Seizing the telephone, he
called up the prison.</p>

<p>“Shoot every political prisoner!” he ordered.</p>

<p>But with the death of Joaquín a change had come
over the Republic. It was Joaquín the people
feared, and not Federico. The order was not
obeyed. Surrounded by foreign soldiers of fortune,
the ex-Dictator emerged from the castle only to attend
his brother’s funeral. Then, in a heavily-guarded
train, he fled to Puerto Limón, and sailed
for Europe.</p>

<p>As was my usual fortune in Latin-American
travel, I arrived just in time to hear the shouting.
And all Costa Rica <em>was</em> shouting. When I drew any
young man aside to ask who it was that shot Joaquín,
he would glance hastily about to see that he
was not overheard. Then he would whisper:</p>

<p>“Sh! Don’t tell any one! <em>I</em> did it!”</p>

<p>But Joaquín had his mourners. Every day several
young ladies would visit his grave to deck it with
flowers, each glaring jealously at the others who
loved his memory.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>This story, it should be emphasized again, is not
typical of Costa Rica. Although the second smallest
of the Central-American republics, it is the most
progressive.</p>

<p>Fortune favored it in the beginning by giving it
few gold mines to attract to its shores the swashbuckling
adventurer whose blood to-day keeps so many
of the neighboring countries in turmoil. It is essentially
a country of coffee and bananas, and so fertile
that wooden railway ties and telegraph poles are
popularly reputed to take root and grow. It was
settled not by <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">conquistadores</i> bent upon enslaving
the Indian, but by Gallegos, the hardest-working
farmers of Spain, who, instead of mating with the
aborigines, followed the example of our own Puritan
forefathers by exterminating them. To-day,
when one passes the black fringe of the Caribbean
coast, one finds neither the Indian population of
Guatemala nor the mixed-breed population of the
other countries, but a race eighty per cent. Spanish,
even among the lowly <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peons</i>.</p>

<p>Not being troubled by recurrent civil war, Costa
Rica has made progress. It is not an astounding
country, for most of its 23,000 square miles of territory
are still clad with jungle, and its population
of 400,000 people live mostly in one mountain district,
where the four principal cities are connected
by a wagon road not more than thirty miles in
length. But its people, for the most part, own their
own farms, and are contented. Education is of a
higher standard than in the other countries. There
is railway connection with either coast. It is such
a healthful land that Canal Zone doctors always
recommend it to convalescents. It has a national
theater which equals in its interior decoration
any theater in the United States. Yet it remains
quaint, and picturesque, and Spanish&mdash;charming
and delightful&mdash;so thoroughly charming and delightful
that the author, after living there for a
month on two different visits, discovers no further
observations in his notebook.</p>

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>To be fair to these countries, no story of revolution
is altogether typical of any of them.</p>

<p>Life even in Mexico or Honduras is normally tranquil.
Bloodshed and comic opera are not the rule,
but the exception. <span id="republic">If all of these republics have
their turbulent moments, they quickly recover</span>.</p>

<p>After the flight of Tinoco, Costa Rica settled
quickly into its accustomed routine. Through the
narrow Moorish streets the oxen plodded slowly
behind the driver’s goad-pole, their noses to the
ground, their massive shoulders swaying from side
to side. In the coffee fields outside the capital the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peons</i> laughed and chatted as they filled their
baskets with red berries. In the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i> the military
band played on Sunday evenings, while youths and
maidens strolled beneath the palm trees. And the
same moon that smiled upon Mexico peeped over
the low flat roofs, while the plaintive notes of the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gendarme’s</i> whistle echoed through the quiet city
with its benediction of “All’s well.”</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>A fruit steamer carried me back to New
Orleans.</p>

<p>After several months of travel in Mexico
and Central America&mdash;travel marked by many delays,
by many postponements until <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mañana</i>, by
many controversies with petty officials, and by many
struggles with the pompous formality of diminutive
republics&mdash;one looked forward to landing again in
an Anglo-Saxon country.</p>

<p>The steamer docked at eight in the evening. The
immigration inspector had gone home. “How soon
may we land?” the passengers inquired. “To-morrow,”
was the answer. We spent the next
several hours filling out an inventory of our personal
baggage for the benefit of the customs’ service.
Foreigners answered a lengthy questionnaire
containing such queries as, “Are you an anarchist?”,
“Are you a polygamist?”, and “Do you believe
in the overthrow of the United States’ government
by force?” The only officials that were on the
job were the prohibition agents. They came aboard
in search of liquor. So the captain took them to his
cabin, and opened a bottle of Scotch.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>On the Pullman that carried me northward to
New York, a traveling man engaged me in conversation.</p>

<p>“I see you’ve been to South America. I noticed
the Nicaragua label on your suit-case. How’s things
down there? Pretty wild bunch, ain’t they?”</p>

<p>And he laid aside his newspaper, which contained
accounts of one lynching, one fist fight on the floor
of Congress, four fashionable divorce scandals, one
Ku Klux Klan outrage, sixteen robberies, two incendiary
fires, seven murders, and the innumerable
charges and countercharges of bribery and corruption
which distinguish a presidential campaign.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Perhaps, since in my first chapter my destination
was Panama, I ought to mention it. I stopped there
for several weeks after my first flight from Mexico.</p>

<p>The Canal Zone, regarded as an example of what
Anglo-Saxon efficiency can do to the tropics, was
quite astounding. The once fever-stricken swamp
had become a well-ordered garden of palm-shaded
walks lined with neat cottages. The screening which
inclosed each dwelling was no longer necessary.
The malaria-bearing mosquito had departed. In
the big ditch steamers were handled with the regularity
of clockwork. They plowed into the huge
locks; giant doors swung shut behind them; water
poured as though by magic into the artificial pool,
raising the vessels to the higher level of Gatun Lake;
the doors opened; the ships steamed away toward
the Pacific. Everything in the Zone ran smoothly,
with the same mechanical precision that marked the
operation of the Canal.</p>

<p>But nowhere in the Americanized territory did
one find the quiet contentment of the Latin Countries.
Whenever the American employees wished
to enjoy life, they crossed the boundary into the
Republic of Panama, to the land of music, and
tinkling fountains, martini cocktails, and dark-eyed
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">señoritas</i>.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Among the many letters awaiting me at home,
there was one with a Mexican postmark. It was
from the long-lost Eustace. It said:</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ll wonder why I haven’t written
you before. The fact is, I’ve fallen into the swing
of things down here, and keep putting everything off
until <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mañana</i>.</p>

<p>“After I left you in Mexico City that day, ever
so long ago, I reached Manzanillo without difficulty.
There was nothing thrilling about my escape. I
simply boarded a steamer and sailed away.</p>

<p>“For a couple of years after that I damned Mexico,
and made fun of it, and talked about its many
faults. I told the story of our heroic flight from
Zamorra, and later from Carranza, until I was
bored with it myself. The funny thing is that I
presently began to hanker to go back. There’s something
about Mexico. You can’t explain it. And as
soon as Carranza gave place to Obregon, I went
back.</p>

<p>“I’m cashier now at a mine in Durango. It belongs
to that chap Werner we met in Mazatlán.
Once in a while the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peons</i> get drunk and shoot each
other up, but as a rule everything’s quiet. There’s
an air of peace and calm and ease and leisure that
you don’t find at home. At first it gets a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo’s</i>
goat. Then he accustoms himself to it, and likes it.
He doesn’t have to answer an alarm clock, or rush
for a subway train, or reach an office at a prescribed
hour, or dash out for a hasty bite of lunch between
business engagements, or punch a time clock, or take
efficiency tests, or come home hanging to a trolley
strap. He can settle any troublesome question in
the native fashion by postponing it until <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mañana</i>.</p>

<p>“I like these people, too. There’s nothing much
that a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gringo</i> can say to their credit. But when you
get into their ways, they’re mighty likeable. And
I’ve gotten completely into their ways. I’m married.
No, it wasn’t Lolita. When I reached Mazatlán
I found that Werner had married her. When he
went around to break the news of our fictitious
death, he got acquainted, and stepped off with my
old sweetheart. So I’ve married Herminia. I’ve
told her that our cablegram was sheer bunk, and that
you’re still alive, but the news no longer seems
to thrill her, although she would like to be remembered
to you.</p>

<p>“It looks like I’m settled here for life. Whenever
I suggest taking a trip back to California,
Herminia is frightened stiff. Every one down here
considers the old U. S. too dangerous a place to visit.
Just as we get mostly the bandit stories from Mexico,
so they get all the train robberies and lynching
news from home. Just as our people regard all
Mexicans as chronic revolutionists, so the Mexicans
look upon us as a lot of bank-looters who, when not
professionally occupied, take our diversion in chasing
colored people and stringing them to lamp-posts.</p>

<p>“I’ve just received word that our old friend Barlow
is dead. Do you remember how pessimistic he
was about the dangers of Mexico? Always carrying
a gun, and warning everybody to take no chances?
He went home to the States last month, and died
from drinking wood alcohol.</p>

<p>“Some time ago I met a former acquaintance
of ours. It was that oily little fellow that came to
our room in Mexico City&mdash;Mario Sanchez, aide to
His Excellency, Venustiano Carranza. I lent him
the price of a square meal. He had lost his job when
Carranza ducked out of the capital with Obregon
after him. We got rather chummy, and I asked him
whether he really had been planning to murder us.
And what do you think? Carranza himself believed
that yarn about our being captured by Zamorra. He
merely wanted to give us each five hundred dollars
to keep quiet about it! And to think we both went
scampering out of Mexico! And wondered why no
one stopped us!</p>

<p>“But I’m pretty well satisfied with the way things
have turned out. And this brings me to the main
reason for coming out of my lethargy to write a
letter. I do so from sheer pride. I’ve become a
parent. Very much so. It’s twins. All of which
goes to prove your old contention that this is a country
whose charm lies in its habit of providing the
unexpected.</p>

<p>“So good luck, and <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Adios</i>!”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
